For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported.

Below is a very simple implementation that will get projects relying on a custom `get_connection` implementation unblocked.\r\n\r\nHowever, we _strongly_ recommend maintainers evaluate if their custom `get_connection` is subject to the same issues as the CVE above and make appropriate changes as needed.\r\n\r\n**Minimum new code to work as a pass-through**\r\nThis will be backwards compatible between versions of Requests.\r\n```python\r\ndef get_connection_with_tls_context(self, request, verify, proxies=None, cert=None):\r\n    return self.get_connection(request.url, proxies)\r\n```",

It should\r\n  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python\r\n  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)\r\n- Requests now supports optional use of character detection\r\n  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.\r\n  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring\r\n  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs\r\n  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)\r\n\r\n**Bugfixes**\r\n- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly\r\n  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)\r\n- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)\r\n- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead\r\n  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)\r\n\r\n**Deprecations**\r\n\r\n- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)\r\n- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)\r\n- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)\r\n- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)\r\n\r\n**Documentation**\r\n- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.\r\n\r\n**Packaging**\r\n- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.\r\n  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located\r\n  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)\r\n- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system\r\n  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old\r\n  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.", "created_at": "2024-05-20T15:30:48Z", "updated_at":

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.0 - 15 Apr 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The deprecated feature for extracting dependencies for a Python analysis has been removed. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2224\">#2224</a></p>\n<p>As a result, the following inputs and environment variables are now ignored:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <code>setup-python-dependencies</code> input to the <code>init</code> Action</li>\n<li>The <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION</code> environment variable</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We recommend removing any references to these from your workflows.

Install `simplejson` in a virtual environment\r\n```\r\npip install simplejson\r\n```\r\n2. Without the proposed change, [this test](https://github.com/psf/requests/compare/main...jon-behnken:requests:main#diff-05180dda5cdc530f95d400932961d6152bd515a6447af23d22c7f335b390b9d8R2810) should fail:\r\n```\r\npytest tests/test_requests.py -k test_json_decode_compatibility \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why\r\nImplementations like this should behave as expected:\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n    response = requests.get(\"https://www.example.com/data\").json()\r\nexcept json.JSONDecodeError:\r\n    # do something\r\n```\r\nbut this exception does not get caught. Currently you must use `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` which is a bit unintuitive.

It runs a bunch of concurrent requests against a URL, both with certificate verification enabled and disabled, and outputs the time it takes to do it in both cases.\r\n\r\n```py\r\nfrom time import time\r\nfrom threading import Thread\r\nimport requests\r\nimport urllib3\r\n\r\nurllib3.disable_warnings()\r\n\r\ndef do_request(verify):\r\n    requests.get('https://example.com', verify=verify)\r\n\r\ndef measure(verify):\r\n    threads = [Thread(target=do_request, args=(verify,)) for _ in range(30)]\r\n\r\n    start = time()\r\n    for t in threads: t.start()\r\n    for t in threads: t.join()\r\n    end = time()\r\n\r\n    print(end - start)\r\n\r\nmeasure(verify=True)\r\nmeasure(verify=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat's the time difference between the two? It turns out it is highly dependent on your local configuration. On my local machine, with a relatively modern config (Python 3.12 + OpenSSL 3.0.2), the times are `~1.2s` for `verify=True` and `~0.5s` for `verify=False`.\r\n\r\nIt's a >100% difference, but we initially blamed it on cert verification taking some time. However, we observed even larger differences (>500%) in some environments, and decided to find out what was going on.\r\n\r\n## Problem description\r\n\r\nOur main use case for requests is running lots of requests concurrently, and we spent some time bisecting this oddity to see if there was room for a performance optimization.\r\n\r\nThe issue is a bit more clear if you profile the concurrent executions. When verifying certs, these are the top 3 function calls by time spent in them:\r\n\r\n```\r\nncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\r\n30/1    0.681    0.023    0.002    0.002 {method 'load_verify_locations' of '_ssl._SSLContext' objects}\r\n30/1    0.181    0.006    0.002    0.002 {method 'connect' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n60/2    0.180    0.003    1.323    0.662 {method 'read' of '_ssl._SSLSocket' objects}\r\n```\r\n\r\nConversely, this is how the top 3 looks like without cert verification:\r\n\r\n```\r\nncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)\r\n30/1    0.233    0.008    0.001    0.001 {method 'do_handshake' of '_ssl._SSLSocket' objects}\r\n30/1    0.106    0.004    0.002    0.002 {method 'connect' of '_socket.socket' objects}\r\n60/2    0.063    0.001    0.505    0.253 {method 'read' of '_ssl._SSLSocket' objects}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the first case, a full 0.68 seconds are spent in the `load_verify_locations()` function of the `ssl` module, which configures a `SSLContext` object to use a set of CA certificates for validation. Inside it, there is a C FFI call to OpenSSL's `SSL_CTX_load_verify_locations()` which [is known](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/95031) to be [quite slow](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/16871). This happens once per request (hence the `30` on the left).\r\n\r\nWe believe that, in some cases, there is even some blocking going on, either because each FFI call locks up the GIL or because of some thread safety mechanisms in OpenSSL itself. We also think that this is more or less pronounced depending on internal changes between OpenSSL's versions, hence the variability between environments.\r\n\r\nWhen cert validation isn't needed, these calls are skipped which speeds up concurrent performance dramatically.\r\n\r\n## Submitted solution\r\n\r\nIt isn't possible to skip loading root CA certificates entirely, but it isn't necessary to do it on every request. More specifically, a call to `load_verify_locations()` happens when:\r\n\r\n- A new `urllib3.connectionpool.HTTPSConnectionPool` is created.\r\n\r\n- On connection, by urllib3's `ssl_wrap_socket()`, when the connection's `ca_certs` or `ca_cert_dir` attributes are set (see [the relevant code](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/9929d3c4e03b71ba485148a8390cd9411981f40f/src/urllib3/util/ssl_.py#L438)).\r\n\r\nThe first case doesn't need to be addressed anymore after the latest addition of `_get_connection()`. Since it now passes  down `pool_kwargs`, this allows urllib3 to use a cached pool with the same settings every time, instead of creating one per request.\r\n\r\nThe second one is addressed in this PR. If a verified connection is requested, `_urllib3_request_context()` already makes it so that a connection pool using a `SSLContext` with all relevant certificates loaded is always used. Hence, there is no need to trigger a call to `load_verify_locations()` again.\r\n\r\nYou can test against https://invalid.badssl.com to check that `verify=True` and `verify=False` still behave as expected and are now equally fast.\r\n\r\nI'd like to mention that there have been a few changes in Requests since I started drafting this, and I'm not sure that setting `conn.ca_certs` or `conn.ca_certs = cert_loc` in `cert_verify()` is even still needed, since I think that the logic could be moved to `_urllib3_request_context()` and benefit from using a cached context in those cases too.", "created_at": "2024-03-20T11:51:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-06-19T13:17:44Z", "closed_at": "2024-05-15T20:07:26Z", "merged_at": "2024-05-15T20:07:26Z", "merge_commit_sha":

This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. You can override this behavior by setting <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION=false</code> in your workflow, however we plan to remove this ability in future versions of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2031\">#2031</a></li>\n<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.11.6 or later.

deserializable: calling `pickle.dumps` followed by `pickle.loads` will trigger an error.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly a problem in a process pool, as an attempt to decode json on an invalid json document will result in the entire process pool crashing.\r\n\r\nThis is due to the MRO of the `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` class: the `__reduce__` method called when pickling an instance is not the one from the JSON library parent: two out of three args expected for instantiation will be dropped, and the instance can't be deserialised.\r\n\r\nBy specifying in the class which parent `__reduce__` method should be called, the bug is fixed as all args are carried over in the resulting pickled bytes.", "created_at": "2024-01-31T16:14:59Z", "updated_at": "2024-02-29T09:34:49Z",

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.23.0 - 08 Jan 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>We are rolling out a feature in January 2024 that will disable Python dependency installation by default for all users. This improves the speed of analysis while having only a very minor impact on results. You can override this behavior by setting <code>CODEQL_ACTION_DISABLE_PYTHON_DEPENDENCY_INSTALLATION=false</code> in your workflow, however we plan to remove this ability in future versions of the CodeQL Action. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2031\">#2031</a></li>\n<li>The CodeQL Action now requires CodeQL version 2.11.6 or later. For more information, see <a href=\"https://github.com/github/codeql-action/blob/main/#2227---16-nov-2023\">the corresponding changelog entry for CodeQL Action version 2.22.7</a>. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2009\">#2009</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.22.12 - 22 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2047\">#2047</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.22.11 - 13 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>[v3+ only] The CodeQL Action now runs on Node.js v20. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2006\">#2006</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.10 - 12 Dec 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.4. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2016\">#2016</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.9 - 07 Dec 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>2.22.8 - 23 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.3. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2001\">#2001</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.7 - 16 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.11.5 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 8 November 2023 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.7, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action v2.23.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1993\">#1993</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.11.6 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.10.5 and 2.11.5, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.22.7</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.6 - 14 Nov 2023</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Customers running Python analysis on macOS using version 2.14.6 or earlier of the CodeQL CLI should upgrade to CodeQL CLI version 2.15.0 or later. If you do not wish to upgrade the CodeQL CLI, ensure that you are using Python version 3.11 or earlier, as CodeQL version 2.14.6 and earlier do not support Python 3.12. You can achieve this by adding a <a href=\"https://github.com/actions/setup-python\"><code>setup-python</code></a> step to your code scanning workflow before the step that invokes <code>github/codeql-action/init</code>.</li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.15.2. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/1978\">#1978</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>2.22.5 - 27 Oct 2023</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Maybe it's the time that doubled the connection timeout.\r\n+ Of course there may be more.\r\n+ You can also consider extreme solutions, such as having the specified domain name return only one IP address.\r\n+ For example, if DNS returns both IPv4 DNS records (A) and IPv6 DNS records (AAAA), patch it so that it does not return IPv6.\r\n+ However, new issues may arise.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it Suits

I wasn't sure what the right thing to do here was, but I went with my intuition, and kept commits pretty discrete so I can drop/amend them if the maintainers want me to do something different.
