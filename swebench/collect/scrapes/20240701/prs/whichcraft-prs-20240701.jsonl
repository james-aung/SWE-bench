This PR adds PEP 561 type stubs.\r\n\r\nAs part of adding the type stubs, it was necessary to restructure `whichcraft` as a package rather than a single-file module, so that the `*.pyi` and `py.typed` could be included. This follows the recommendations in PEP 561 to avoid naming conflicts.\r\n\r\nThis change should be fully backwards-compatible, as the type stub files will only be taken into account by type checkers which implement the syntax for versions >= 3.7 (see [type stub documentation](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/stubs.html#syntax)).\r\n\r\n`tox` runs clean on Windows with Python 2.7, 3.6 and 3.7.", "created_at": "2023-04-01T14:49:43Z", "updated_at": "2023-08-16T03:34:50Z", "closed_at": "2023-08-16T03:34:50Z", "merged_at": "2023-08-16T03:34:50Z", "merge_commit_sha":
