This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.3.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nNew features\n------------\n\n- `12231 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231&gt;`_: Added `--xfail-tb` flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.\n\n  * If the `--xfail-tb` flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.\n  * The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with `--tb`, and can be `auto|long|short|line|native|no`.\n  * Note: Even if you have `--xfail-tb` set, you won&#x27;t see them if `--tb=no`.\n\n  Some history:\n\n  With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don&#x27;t want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.\n\n  This change detaches xfail tracebacks from `-rx`, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with `--xfail-tb`. With this, the default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.\n\n\n- `12281 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281&gt;`_: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.\n\n  Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\n  Supported values are :class:`int`, (unescaped) :class:`str`, :class:`bool` &amp; :data:`None`.\n\n  See :ref:`marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;` for more information.\n\n  -- by :user:`lovetheguitar`\n\n\n- `12567 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567&gt;`_: Added ``--no-fold-skipped`` command line option.\n\n  If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\n  by reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\n  way as other statuses.\n\n  -- by :user:`pbrezina`\n\n\n\nImprovements in existing functionality\n--------------------------------------\n\n- `12469 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469&gt;`_: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,\n  replacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\n  reference to :std:doc:`setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;`\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n\n\n- `12544 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544&gt;`_, `#12545 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545&gt;`_: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\n  checking for a :file:`pyvenv.cfg` file, ensuring reliable detection on\n  various platforms -- by :user:`zachsnickers`.\n\n\n- `2871 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2871&gt;`_: Do not truncate arguments to functions in output when running with `-vvv`.\n\n\n- `389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/389&gt;`_: The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced\n  -- by :user:`farbodahm`, :user:`webknjaz`, :user:`obestwalter`, :user:`flub`\n  and :user:`glyphack`.\n\n  Earlier, it was like:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      =================================== FAILURES ===================================\n      _____________________________________ test _____________________________________\n\n          def test():\n      &gt;

Regressed in 8.2.2.\n\n\n- `12472 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12472&gt;`_: Fixed a crash when returning category ``&quot;error&quot;`` or ``&quot;failed&quot;`` with a custom test status from :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook -- :user:`pbrezina`.\n\n\n- `12505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12505&gt;`_: Improved handling of invalid regex patterns in :func:`pytest.raises(match=r&#x27;...&#x27;) &lt;pytest.raises&gt;` by providing a clear error message.\n\n\n- `12580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12580&gt;`_: Fixed a crash when using the cache class on Windows and the cache directory was created concurrently.\n\n\n- `6962 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962&gt;`_: Parametrization parameters are now compared using `==` instead of `is` (`is` is still used as a fallback if the parameter does not support `==`).\n  This fixes use of parameters such as lists, which have a different `id` but compare equal, causing fixtures to be re-computed instead of being cached.\n\n\n- `7166 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7166&gt;`_: Fixed progress percentages (the ``[ 87%]`` at the edge of the screen) sometimes not aligning correctly when running with pytest-xdist ``-n``.\n\n\n\nImproved documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `12153 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12153&gt;`_: Documented using :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` to detect if code is running from within a pytest run.\n\n\n- `12469 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469&gt;`_: The external plugin mentions in the documentation now avoid mentioning\n  :std:doc:`setuptools entry-points &lt;setuptools:index&gt;` as the concept is\n  much more generic nowadays. Instead, the terminology of &quot;external&quot;,\n  &quot;installed&quot;, or &quot;third-party&quot; plugins (or packages) replaces that.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12577 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12577&gt;`_: `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables role is discribed in\n  the reference doc. They now also appear when doing `pytest -h`\n  -- by :user:`MarcBresson`.\n\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- `12467 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12467&gt;`_: Migrated all internal type-annotations to the python3.10+ style by using the `annotations` future import.\n\n  -- by :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt`\n\n\n- `11771 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11771&gt;`_, `#12557 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12557&gt;`_: The PyPy runtime version has been updated to 3.9 from 3.8 that introduced\n  a flaky bug at the garbage collector which was not expected to fix there\n  as the 3.8 is EoL.\n\n  -- by :user:`x612skm`\n\n\n- `12493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12493&gt;`_: The change log draft preview integration has been refactored to use a\n  third party extension ``sphinxcontib-towncrier``. The previous in-repo\n  script was putting the change log preview file at\n  :file:`doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst`. Said file is no longer\n  ignored in Git and might show up among untracked files in the\n  development environments of the contributors. To address that, the\n  contributors can run the following command that will clean it up:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n     $ git clean -x -i -- doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12498 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12498&gt;`_: All the undocumented ``tox`` environments now have descriptions.\n  They can be listed in one&#x27;s development environment by invoking\n  ``tox -av`` in a terminal.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12501 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12501&gt;`_: The changelog configuration has been updated to introduce more accurate\n  audience-tailored categories. Previously, there was a ``trivial``\n  change log fragment type with an unclear and broad meaning. It was\n  removed and we now have ``contrib``, ``misc`` and ``packaging`` in\n  place of it.\n\n  The new change note types target the readers who are downstream\n  packagers and project contributors. Additionally, the miscellaneous\n  section is kept for unspecified updates that do not fit anywhere else.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12502 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12502&gt;`_: The UX of the GitHub automation making pull requests to update the\n  plugin list has been updated. Previously, the maintainers had to close\n  the automatically created pull requests and re-open them to trigger the\n  CI runs. From now on, they only need to click the `Ready for review`\n  button instead.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12522 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12522&gt;`_: The ``:pull:`` RST role has been replaced with a shorter\n  ``:pr:`` due to starting to use the implementation from\n  the third-party :pypi:`sphinx-issues` Sphinx extension\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n\n\n- `12531 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12531&gt;`_: The coverage reporting configuration has been updated to exclude\n  pytest&#x27;s own tests marked as expected to fail from the coverage\n  report. This has an effect of reducing the influence of flaky\n  tests on the resulting number.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12533 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12533&gt;`_: The ``extlinks`` Sphinx extension is no longer enabled. The ``:bpo:``\n  role it used to declare has been removed with that. BPO itself has\n  migrated to GitHub some years ago and it is possible to link the\n  respective issues by using their GitHub issue numbers and the\n  ``:issue:`` role that the ``sphinx-issues`` extension implements.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12562&gt;`_: Possible typos in using the ``:user:`` RST role is now being linted\n  through the pre-commit tool integration -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.2.2\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `12355 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12355&gt;`_: Fix possible catastrophic performance slowdown on a certain parametrization pattern involving many higher-scoped parameters.\n\n\n- `12367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12367&gt;`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where unittest class instances (a fresh one is created for each test) were not released promptly on test teardown but only on session teardown.\n\n\n- `12381 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12381&gt;`_: Fix possible &quot;Directory not empty&quot; crashes arising from concurent cache dir (``.pytest_cache``) creation. Regressed in pytest 8.2.0.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `12290 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12290&gt;`_: Updated Sphinx theme to use Furo instead of Flask, enabling Dark mode theme.\n\n\n- `12356 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12356&gt;`_: Added a subsection to the documentation for debugging flaky tests to mention\n  lack of thread safety in pytest as a possible source of flakyness.\n\n\n- `12363 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12363&gt;`_: The documentation webpages now links to a canonical version to reduce outdated documentation in search engine results.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.2.1\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `12334 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12334&gt;`_: Support for Python 3.13 (beta1 at the time of writing).\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `12120 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12120&gt;`_: Fix `PermissionError` crashes arising from directories which are not selected on the command-line.\n\n\n- `12191 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12191&gt;`_: Keyboard interrupts and system exits are now properly handled during the test collection.\n\n\n- `12300 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300&gt;`_: Fixed handling of &#x27;Function not implemented&#x27; error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.\n\n\n- `12308 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308&gt;`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created ``.pytest_cache`` directories became ``rwx------`` instead of the expected ``rwxr-xr-x``.\n\n\n\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n------------------------\n\n- `12333 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333&gt;`_: pytest releases are now attested using the recent `Artifact Attestation &lt;https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/&gt;`_ support from GitHub, allowing users to verify the provenance of pytest&#x27;s sdist and wheel artifacts.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.2.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\n- `12089 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12089&gt;`_: pytest now requires that :class:`unittest.TestCase` subclasses can be instantiated freely using ``MyTestCase(&#x27;runTest&#x27;)``.\n\n  If the class doesn&#x27;t allow this, you may see an error during collection such as ``AttributeError: &#x27;MyTestCase&#x27; object has no attribute &#x27;runTest&#x27;``.\n\n  Classes which do not override ``__init__``, or do not access the test method in ``__init__`` using ``getattr`` or similar, are unaffected.\n\n  Classes which do should take care to not crash when ``&quot;runTest&quot;`` is given, as is shown in `unittest.TestCases&#x27;s implementation &lt;https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/51aefc5bf907ddffaaf083ded0de773adcdf08c8/Lib/unittest/case.py#L419-L426&gt;`_.\n  Alternatively, consider using :meth:`setUp &lt;unittest.TestCase.setUp&gt;` instead of ``__init__``.\n\n  If you run into this issue using ``tornado.AsyncTestCase``, please see `issue 12263 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12263&gt;`_.\n\n  If you run into this issue using an abstract ``TestCase`` subclass, please see `issue 12275 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12275&gt;`_.\n\n  Historical note: the effect of this change on custom TestCase implementations was not properly considered initially, this is why it was done in a minor release. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nDeprecations\n------------\n\n- `12069 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069&gt;`_: A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated ``py.path.local`` parameter instead of the ``pathlib.Path`` parameter which replaced it:\n\n  - :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``collection_path`` instead.\n  - :hook:`pytest_collect_file` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``file_path`` instead.\n  - :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule` - the ``path`` parameter - use ``module_path`` instead.\n  - :hook:`pytest_report_header` - the ``startdir`` parameter - use ``start_path`` instead.\n  - :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish` - the ``startdir`` parameter - use ``start_path`` instead.\n\n  The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.\n  The old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.\n\n  See :ref:`legacy-path-hooks-deprecated` for more details.\n\n\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- `11871 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871&gt;`_: Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character `, like e.g.: ``pytest tests.txt``. The file must have one argument per line.\n\n  See :ref:`Read arguments from file &lt;args-from-file&gt;` for details.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `11523 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523&gt;`_: :func:`pytest.importorskip` will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised :class:`ImportError` instead of :class:`ModuleNotFoundError`.\n\n  The warning can be suppressed by passing ``exc_type=ImportError`` to :func:`pytest.importorskip`.\n\n  See :ref:`import-or-skip-import-error` for details.\n\n\n- `11728 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728&gt;`_: For ``unittest``-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with :meth:`TestCase.addClassCleanup &lt;unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup&gt;`) are now reported instead of silently failing.\n\n\n- `11777 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777&gt;`_: Text is no longer truncated in the ``short test summary info`` section when ``-vv`` is given.\n\n\n- `12112 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112&gt;`_: Improved namespace packages detection when :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).\n\n\n- `9502 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502&gt;`_: Added :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of ``pytest.__version__``, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `12065 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065&gt;`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing ``setup_method`` and tests using ``staticmethod`` or ``classmethod`` would crash with ``AttributeError: &#x27;NoneType&#x27; object has no attribute &#x27;setup_method&#x27;``.\n\n  Now the :attr:`request.instance &lt;pytest.FixtureRequest.instance&gt;` attribute of tests using ``staticmethod`` and ``classmethod`` is no longer ``None``, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.\n  Previously it was ``None``, and all fixtures of such tests would share a single ``self``.\n\n\n- `12135 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12135&gt;`_: Fixed issue where fixtures adding their finalizer multiple times to fixtures they request would cause unreliable and non-intuitive teardown ordering in some instances.\n\n\n- `12194 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12194&gt;`_: Fixed a bug with ``--importmode=importlib`` and ``--doctest-modules`` where child modules did not appear as attributes in parent modules.\n\n\n- `1489 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1489&gt;`_: Fixed some instances where teardown of higher-scoped fixtures was not happening in the reverse order they were initialized in.\n\n\n\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n------------------------\n\n- `12069 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069&gt;`_: ``pluggy&gt;=1.5.0`` is now required.\n\n\n- `12167 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12167&gt;`_: :ref:`cache &lt;cache&gt;`: create supporting files (``CACHEDIR.TAG``, ``.gitignore``, etc.) in a temporary directory to provide atomic semantics.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.1.2\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `12114 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12114&gt;`_: Fixed error in :func:`pytest.approx` when used with `numpy` arrays and comparing with other types.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.1.1\n   ```\n   =========================\n\n.. note::\n\n       This release is not a usual bug fix release -- it contains features and improvements, being a follow up\n       to ``8.1.0``, which has been yanked from PyPI.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- `11475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475&gt;`_: Added the new :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` configuration option, defaulting to ``False``.\n\n  If set to ``True``, pytest will attempt to identify modules that are part of `namespace packages &lt;https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages&gt;`__ when importing modules.\n\n\n- `11653 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11653&gt;`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_test_cases` configuration option for fine-grained control of test execution verbosity.\n  See :ref:`Fine-grained verbosity &lt;pytest.fine_grained_verbosity&gt;` for more details.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `10865 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10865&gt;`_: :func:`pytest.warns` now validates that :func:`warnings.warn` was called with a `str` or a `Warning`.\n  Currently in Python it is possible to use other types, however this causes an exception when :func:`warnings.filterwarnings` is used to filter those warnings (see `CPython 103577 &lt;https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103577&gt;`__ for a discussion).\n  While this can be considered a bug in CPython, we decided to put guards in pytest as the error message produced without this check in place is confusing.\n\n\n- `11311 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11311&gt;`_: When using ``--override-ini`` for paths in invocations without a configuration file defined, the current working directory is used\n  as the relative directory.\n\n  Previously this would raise an :class:`AssertionError`.\n\n\n- `11475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475&gt;`_: :ref:`--import-mode=importlib &lt;import-mode-importlib&gt;` now tries to import modules using the standard import mechanism (but still without changing :py:data:`sys.path`), falling back to importing modules directly only if that fails.\n\n  This means that installed packages will be imported under their canonical name if possible first, for example ``app.core.models``, instead of having the module name always be derived from their path (for example ``.env310.lib.site_packages.app.core.models``).\n\n\n- `11801 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11801&gt;`_: Added the :func:`iter_parents() &lt;_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_parents&gt;` helper method on nodes.\n  It is similar to :func:`listchain &lt;_pytest.nodes.Node.listchain&gt;`, but goes from bottom to top, and returns an iterator, not a list.\n\n\n- `11850 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11850&gt;`_: Added support for :data:`sys.last_exc` for post-mortem debugging on Python&gt;=3.12.\n\n\n- `11962 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11962&gt;`_: In case no other suitable candidates for configuration file are found, a ``pyproject.toml`` (even without a ``[tool.pytest.ini_options]`` table) will be considered as the configuration file and define the ``rootdir``.\n\n\n- `11978 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11978&gt;`_: Add ``--log-file-mode`` option to the logging plugin, enabling appending to log-files. This option accepts either ``&quot;w&quot;`` or ``&quot;a&quot;`` and defaults to ``&quot;w&quot;``.\n\n  Previously, the mode was hard-coded to be ``&quot;w&quot;`` which truncates the file before logging.\n\n\n- `12047 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12047&gt;`_: When multiple finalizers of a fixture raise an exception, now all exceptions are reported as an exception group.\n  Previously, only the first exception was reported.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11475 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475&gt;`_: Fixed regression where ``--importmode=importlib`` would import non-test modules more than once.\n\n\n- `11904 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904&gt;`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to fail due to permission errors when using ``--pyargs``.\n\n  This change improves the collection tree for tests specified using ``--pyargs``, see :pr:`12043` for a comparison with pytest 8.0 and &lt;8.\n\n\n- `12011 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12011&gt;`_: Fixed a regression in 8.0.1 whereby ``setup_module`` xunit-style fixtures are not executed when ``--doctest-modules`` is passed.\n\n\n- `12014 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12014&gt;`_: Fix the ``stacklevel`` used when warning about marks used on fixtures.\n\n\n- `12039 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12039&gt;`_: Fixed a regression in ``8.0.2`` where tests created using :fixture:`tmp_path` have been collected multiple times in CI under Windows.\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `11790 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11790&gt;`_: Documented the retention of temporary directories created using the ``tmp_path`` fixture in more detail.\n\n\n\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n------------------------\n\n- `11785 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11785&gt;`_: Some changes were made to private functions which may affect plugins which access them:\n\n  - ``FixtureManager._getautousenames()`` now takes a ``Node`` itself instead of the nodeid.\n  - ``FixtureManager.getfixturedefs()`` now takes the ``Node`` itself instead of the nodeid.\n  - The ``_pytest.nodes.iterparentnodeids()`` function is removed without replacement.\n    Prefer to traverse the node hierarchy itself instead.\n    If you really need to, copy the function from the previous pytest release.\n\n\n- `12069 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069&gt;`_: Delayed the deprecation of the following features to ``9.0.0``:\n\n  * :ref:`node-ctor-fspath-deprecation`.\n  * :ref:`legacy-path-hooks-deprecated`.\n\n  It was discovered after ``8.1.0`` was released that the warnings about the impeding removal were not being displayed, so the team decided to revert the removal.\n\n  This is the reason for ``8.1.0`` being yanked.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.1.0\n   ```\n   =====================\n\n\n.. note::\n\n       This release has been **yanked**: it broke some plugins without the proper warning period, due to\n       some warnings not showing up as expected.\n\n       See `12069 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069&gt;`__.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.0.2\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11895 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11895&gt;`_: Fix collection on Windows where initial paths contain the short version of a path (for example ``c:\\PROGRA~1\\tests``).\n\n\n- `11953 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11953&gt;`_: Fix an ``IndexError`` crash raising from ``getstatementrange_ast``.\n\n\n- `12021 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12021&gt;`_: Reverted a fix to `--maxfail` handling in pytest 8.0.0 because it caused a regression in pytest-xdist whereby session fixture teardowns may get executed multiple times when the max-fails is reached.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.0.1\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11875 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11875&gt;`_: Correctly handle errors from :func:`getpass.getuser` in Python 3.13.\n\n\n- `11879 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11879&gt;`_: Fix an edge case where ``ExceptionInfo._stringify_exception`` could crash :func:`pytest.raises`.\n\n\n- `11906 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11906&gt;`_: Fix regression with :func:`pytest.warns` using custom warning subclasses which have more than one parameter in their `__init__`.\n\n\n- `11907 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11907&gt;`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby calling :func:`pytest.skip` and similar control-flow exceptions within a :func:`pytest.warns()` block would get suppressed instead of propagating.\n\n\n- `11929 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11929&gt;`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby autouse fixtures defined in a module get ignored by the doctests in the module.\n\n\n- `11937 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11937&gt;`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.0.0 whereby items would be collected in reverse order in some circumstances.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.0.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11842 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11842&gt;`_: Properly escape the ``reason`` of a :ref:`skip &lt;pytest.mark.skip ref&gt;` mark when writing JUnit XML files.\n\n\n- `11861 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11861&gt;`_: Avoid microsecond exceeds ``1_000_000`` when using ``log-date-format`` with ``%f`` specifier, which might cause the test suite to crash.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.0.0rc2\n   ```\n   ============================\n\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `11233 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11233&gt;`_: Improvements to ``-r`` for xfailures and xpasses:\n\n  * Report tracebacks for xfailures when ``-rx`` is set.\n  * Report captured output for xpasses when ``-rX`` is set.\n  * For xpasses, add ``-`` in summary between test name and reason, to match how xfail is displayed.\n\n- `11825 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11825&gt;`_: The :hook:`pytest_plugin_registered` hook has a new ``plugin_name`` parameter containing the name by which ``plugin`` is registered.\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11706 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706&gt;`_: Fix reporting of teardown errors in higher-scoped fixtures when using `--maxfail` or `--stepwise`.\n\n  NOTE: This change was reverted in pytest 8.0.2 to fix a `regression &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/1024&gt;`_ it caused in pytest-xdist.\n\n\n- `11758 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11758&gt;`_: Fixed ``IndexError: string index out of range`` crash in ``if highlighted[-1] == &quot;\\n&quot; and source[-1] != &quot;\\n&quot;``.\n  This bug was introduced in pytest 8.0.0rc1.\n\n\n- `9765 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765&gt;`_, `#11816 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11816&gt;`_: Fixed a frustrating bug that afflicted some users with the only error being ``assert mod not in mods``. The issue was caused by the fact that ``str(Path(mod))`` and ``mod.__file__`` don&#x27;t necessarily produce the same string, and was being erroneously used interchangably in some places in the code.\n\n  This fix also broke the internal API of ``PytestPluginManager.consider_conftest`` by introducing a new parameter -- we mention this in case it is being used by external code, even if marked as *private*.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.0.0rc1\n   ```\n   ============================\n\nBreaking Changes\n----------------\n\nOld Deprecations Are Now Errors\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `7363 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7363&gt;`_: **PytestRemovedIn8Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**\n\n  Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as\n  possible, all warnings of type ``PytestRemovedIn8Warning`` now generate errors\n  instead of warning messages by default.\n\n  **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 8.1**, so please consult the\n  :ref:`deprecations` section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.\n\n  In the pytest ``8.0.X`` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a\n  stopgap measure by adding this to your ``pytest.ini`` file:\n\n  .. code-block:: ini\n\n      [pytest]\n      filterwarnings =\n          ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning\n\n  But this will stop working when pytest ``8.1`` is released.\n\n  **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a\n  comment to :issue:`7363`.\n\n\nVersion Compatibility\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `11151 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11151&gt;`_: Dropped support for Python 3.7, which `reached end-of-life on 2023-06-27 &lt;https://devguide.python.org/versions/&gt;`__.\n\n\n- ``pluggy&gt;=1.3.0`` is now required.\n\n\nCollection Changes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nIn this version we&#x27;ve made several breaking changes to pytest&#x27;s collection phase,\nparticularly around how filesystem directories and Python packages are collected,\nfixing deficiencies and allowing for cleanups and improvements to pytest&#x27;s internals.\nA deprecation period for these changes was not possible.\n\n\n- `7777 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777&gt;`_: Files and directories are now collected in alphabetical order jointly, unless changed by a plugin.\n  Previously, files were collected before directories.\n  See below for an example.\n\n\n- `8976 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8976&gt;`_: Running `pytest pkg/__init__.py` now collects the `pkg/__init__.py` file (module) only.\n  Previously, it collected the entire `pkg` package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the `__init__.py` file itself\n  (unless :confval:`python_files` was changed to allow `__init__.py` file).\n\n  To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: `pytest pkg`.\n\n\n- `11137 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11137&gt;`_: :class:`pytest.Package` is no longer a :class:`pytest.Module` or :class:`pytest.File`.\n\n  The ``Package`` collector node designates a Python package, that is, a directory with an `__init__.py` file.\n  Previously ``Package`` was a subtype of ``pytest.Module`` (which represents a single Python module),\n  the module being the `__init__.py` file.\n  This has been deemed a design mistake (see :issue:`11137` and :issue:`7777` for details).\n\n  The ``path`` property of ``Package`` nodes now points to the package directory instead of the ``__init__.py`` file.\n\n  Note that a ``Module`` node for ``__init__.py`` (which is not a ``Package``) may still exist,\n  if it is picked up during collection (e.g. if you configured :confval:`python_files` to include ``__init__.py`` files).\n\n\n- `7777 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777&gt;`_: Added a new :class:`pytest.Directory` base collection node, which all collector nodes for filesystem directories are expected to subclass.\n  This is analogous to the existing :class:`pytest.File` for file nodes.\n\n  Changed :class:`pytest.Package` to be a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.\n  A ``Package`` represents a filesystem directory which is a Python package,\n  i.e. contains an ``__init__.py`` file.\n\n  :class:`pytest.Package` now only collects files in its own directory; previously it collected recursively.\n  Sub-directories are collected as their own collector nodes, which then collect themselves, thus creating a collection tree which mirrors the filesystem hierarchy.\n\n  Added a new :class:`pytest.Dir` concrete collection node, a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.\n  This node represents a filesystem directory, which is not a :class:`pytest.Package`,\n  that is, does not contain an ``__init__.py`` file.\n  Similarly to ``Package``, it only collects the files in its own directory.\n\n  :class:`pytest.Session` now only collects the initial arguments, without recursing into directories.\n  This work is now done by the :func:`recursive expansion process &lt;pytest.Collector.collect&gt;` of directory collector nodes.\n\n  :attr:`session.name &lt;pytest.Session.name&gt;` is now ``&quot;&quot;``; previously it was the rootdir directory name.\n  This matches :attr:`session.nodeid &lt;_pytest.nodes.Node.nodeid&gt;` which has always been `&quot;&quot;`.\n\n  The collection tree now contains directories/packages up to the :ref:`rootdir &lt;rootdir&gt;`,\n  for initial arguments that are found within the rootdir.\n  For files outside the rootdir, only the immediate directory/package is collected --\n  note however that collecting from outside the rootdir is discouraged.\n\n  As an example, given the following filesystem tree::\n\n      myroot/\n          pytest.ini\n          top/\n          \u251c\u2500\u2500 aaa\n          \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_aaa.py\n          \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_a.py\n          \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_b\n          \u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n          \u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_b.py\n          \u251c\u2500\u2500 test_c.py\n          \u2514\u2500\u2500 zzz\n              \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n              \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_zzz.py\n\n  the collection tree, as shown by `pytest --collect-only top/` but with the otherwise-hidden :class:`~pytest.Session` node added for clarity,\n  is now the following::\n\n      &lt;Session&gt;\n        &lt;Dir myroot&gt;\n          &lt;Dir top&gt;\n            &lt;Dir aaa&gt;\n              &lt;Module test_aaa.py&gt;\n                &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n            &lt;Module test_a.py&gt;\n              &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n            &lt;Package test_b&gt;\n              &lt;Module test_b.py&gt;\n                &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n            &lt;Module test_c.py&gt;\n              &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n            &lt;Package zzz&gt;\n              &lt;Module test_zzz.py&gt;\n                &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n\n  Previously, it was::\n\n      &lt;Session&gt;\n        &lt;Module top/test_a.py&gt;\n          &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n        &lt;Module top/test_c.py&gt;\n          &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n        &lt;Module top/aaa/test_aaa.py&gt;\n          &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n        &lt;Package test_b&gt;\n          &lt;Module test_b.py&gt;\n            &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n        &lt;Package zzz&gt;\n          &lt;Module test_zzz.py&gt;\n            &lt;Function test_it&gt;\n\n  Code/plugins which rely on a specific shape of the collection tree might need to update.\n\n\n- `11676 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11676&gt;`_: The classes :class:`~_pytest.nodes.Node`, :class:`~pytest.Collector`, :class:`~pytest.Item`, :class:`~pytest.File`, :class:`~_pytest.nodes.FSCollector` are now marked abstract (see :mod:`abc`).\n\n  We do not expect this change to affect users and plugin authors, it will only cause errors when the code is already wrong or problematic.\n\n\nOther breaking changes\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThese are breaking changes where deprecation was not possible.\n\n\n- `11282 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11282&gt;`_: Sanitized the handling of the ``default`` parameter when defining configuration options.\n\n  Previously if ``default`` was not supplied for :meth:`parser.addini &lt;pytest.Parser.addini&gt;` and the configuration option value was not defined in a test session, then calls to :func:`config.getini &lt;pytest.Config.getini&gt;` returned an *empty list* or an *empty string* depending on whether ``type`` was supplied or not respectively, which is clearly incorrect. Also, ``None`` was not honored even if ``default=None`` was used explicitly while defining the option.\n\n  Now the behavior of :meth:`parser.addini &lt;pytest.Parser.addini&gt;` is as follows:\n\n  * If ``default`` is NOT passed but ``type`` is provided, then a type-specific default will be returned. For example ``type=bool`` will return ``False``, ``type=str`` will return ``&quot;&quot;``, etc.\n  * If ``default=None`` is passed and the option is not defined in a test session, then ``None`` will be returned, regardless of the ``type``.\n  * If neither ``default`` nor ``type`` are provided, assume ``type=str`` and return ``&quot;&quot;`` as default (this is as per previous behavior).\n\n  The team decided to not introduce a deprecation period for this change, as doing so would be complicated both in terms of communicating this to the community as well as implementing it, and also because the team believes this change should not break existing plugins except in rare cases.\n\n\n- `11667 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11667&gt;`_: pytest&#x27;s ``setup.py`` file is removed.\n  If you relied on this file, e.g. to install pytest using ``setup.py install``,\n  please see `Why you shouldn&#x27;t invoke setup.py directly &lt;https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html#summary&gt;`_ for alternatives.\n\n\n- `9288 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9288&gt;`_: :func:`~pytest.warns` now re-emits unmatched warnings when the context\n  closes -- previously it would consume all warnings, hiding those that were not\n  matched by the function.\n\n  While this is a new feature, we announce it as a breaking change\n  because many test suites are configured to error-out on warnings, and will\n  therefore fail on the newly-re-emitted warnings.\n\n\n- The internal ``FixtureManager.getfixtureclosure`` method has changed. Plugins which use this method or\n  which subclass ``FixtureManager`` and overwrite that method will need to adapt to the change.\n\n\n\nDeprecations\n------------\n\n- `10465 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10465&gt;`_: Test functions returning a value other than ``None`` will now issue a :class:`pytest.PytestWarning` instead of ``pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning``, meaning this will stay a warning instead of becoming an error in the future.\n\n\n- `3664 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3664&gt;`_: Applying a mark to a fixture function now issues a warning: marks in fixtures never had any effect, but it is a common user error to apply a mark to a fixture (for example ``usefixtures``) and expect it to work.\n\n  This will become an error in pytest 9.0.\n\n\n\nFeatures and Improvements\n-------------------------\n\nImproved Diffs\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThese changes improve the diffs that pytest prints when an assertion fails.\nNote that syntax highlighting requires the ``pygments`` package.\n\n\n- `11520 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11520&gt;`_: The very verbose (``-vv``) diff output is now colored as a diff instead of a big chunk of red.\n\n  Python code in error reports is now syntax-highlighted as Python.\n\n  The sections in the error reports are now better separated.\n\n\n- `1531 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1531&gt;`_: The very verbose diff (``-vv``) for every standard library container type is improved. The indentation is now consistent and the markers are on their own separate lines, which should reduce the diffs shown to users.\n\n  Previously, the standard Python pretty printer was used to generate the output, which puts opening and closing\n  markers on the same line as the first/last entry, in addition to not having consistent indentation.\n\n\n- `10617 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10617&gt;`_: Added more comprehensive set assertion rewrites for comparisons other than equality ``==``, with\n  the following operations now providing better failure messages: ``!=``, ``&lt;=``, ``&gt;=``, ``&lt;``, and ``&gt;``.\n\n\nSeparate Control For Assertion Verbosity\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `11387 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11387&gt;`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_assertions` configuration option for fine-grained control of failed assertions verbosity.\n\n  If you&#x27;ve ever wished that pytest always show you full diffs, but without making everything else verbose, this is for you.\n\n  See :ref:`Fine-grained verbosity &lt;pytest.fine_grained_verbosity&gt;` for more details.\n\n  For plugin authors, :attr:`config.get_verbosity &lt;pytest.Config.get_verbosity&gt;` can be used to retrieve the verbosity level for a specific verbosity type.\n\n\nAdditional Support For Exception Groups and ``__notes__``\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\nThese changes improve pytest&#x27;s support for exception groups.\n\n\n- `10441 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10441&gt;`_: Added :func:`ExceptionInfo.group_contains() &lt;pytest.ExceptionInfo.group_contains&gt;`, an assertion helper that tests if an :class:`ExceptionGroup` contains a matching exception.\n\n  See :ref:`assert-matching-exception-groups` for an example.\n\n\n- `11227 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11227&gt;`_: Allow :func:`pytest.raises` ``match`` argument to match against `PEP-678 &lt;https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/&gt;` ``__notes__``.\n\n\nCustom Directory collectors\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `7777 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777&gt;`_: Added a new hook :hook:`pytest_collect_directory`,\n  which is called by filesystem-traversing collector nodes,\n  such as :class:`pytest.Session`, :class:`pytest.Dir` and :class:`pytest.Package`,\n  to create a collector node for a sub-directory.\n  It is expected to return a subclass of :class:`pytest.Directory`.\n  This hook allows plugins to :ref:`customize the collection of directories &lt;custom directory collectors&gt;`.\n\n\n&quot;New-style&quot; Hook Wrappers\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `11122 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11122&gt;`_: pytest now uses &quot;new-style&quot; hook wrappers internally, available since pluggy 1.2.0.\n  See `pluggy&#x27;s 1.2.0 changelog &lt;https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#pluggy-1-2-0-2023-06-21&gt;`_ and the :ref:`updated docs &lt;hookwrapper&gt;` for details.\n\n  Plugins which want to use new-style wrappers can do so if they require ``pytest&gt;=8``.\n\n\nOther Improvements\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n- `11216 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11216&gt;`_: If a test is skipped from inside an :ref:`xunit setup fixture &lt;classic xunit&gt;`, the test summary now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.\n\n\n- `11314 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11314&gt;`_: Logging to a file using the ``--log-file`` option will use ``--log-level``, ``--log-format`` and ``--log-date-format`` as fallback\n  if ``--log-file-level``, ``--log-file-format`` and ``--log-file-date-format`` are not provided respectively.\n\n\n- `11610 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11610&gt;`_: Added the :func:`LogCaptureFixture.filtering() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.filtering&gt;` context manager which\n  adds a given :class:`logging.Filter` object to the :fixture:`caplog` fixture.\n\n\n- `11447 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11447&gt;`_: :func:`pytest.deprecated_call` now also considers warnings of type :class:`FutureWarning`.\n\n\n- `11600 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11600&gt;`_: Improved the documentation and type signature for :func:`pytest.mark.xfail &lt;pytest.mark.xfail&gt;`&#x27;s ``condition`` param to use ``False`` as the default value.\n\n\n- `7469 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469&gt;`_: :class:`~pytest.FixtureDef` is now exported as ``pytest.FixtureDef`` for typing purposes.\n\n\n- `11353 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11353&gt;`_: Added typing to :class:`~pytest.PytestPluginManager`.\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10701 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10701&gt;`_: :meth:`pytest.WarningsRecorder.pop` will return the most-closely-matched warning in the list,\n  rather than the first warning which is an instance of the requested type.\n\n\n- `11255 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11255&gt;`_: Fixed crash on `parametrize(..., scope=&quot;package&quot;)` without a package present.\n\n\n- `11277 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11277&gt;`_: Fixed a bug that when there are multiple fixtures for an indirect parameter,\n  the scope of the highest-scope fixture is picked for the parameter set, instead of that of the one with the narrowest scope.\n\n\n- `11456 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11456&gt;`_: Parametrized tests now *really do* ensure that the ids given to each input are unique - for\n  example, ``a, a, a0`` now results in ``a1, a2, a0`` instead of the previous (buggy) ``a0, a1, a0``.\n  This necessarily means changing nodeids where these were previously colliding, and for\n  readability adds an underscore when non-unique ids end in a number.\n\n\n- `11563 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11563&gt;`_: Fixed a crash when using an empty string for the same parametrized value more than once.\n\n\n- `11712 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11712&gt;`_: Fixed handling ``NO_COLOR`` and ``FORCE_COLOR`` to ignore an empty value.\n\n\n- `9036 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9036&gt;`_: ``pytest.warns`` and similar functions now capture warnings when an exception is raised inside a ``with`` block.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `11011 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11011&gt;`_: Added a warning about modifying the root logger during tests when using ``caplog``.\n\n\n- `11065 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11065&gt;`_: Use ``pytestconfig`` instead of ``request.config`` in cache example to be consistent with the API documentation.\n\n\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n------------------------\n\n- `11208 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11208&gt;`_: The (internal) ``FixtureDef.cached_result`` type has changed.\n  Now the third item ``cached_result[2]``, when set, is an exception instance instead of an exception triplet.\n\n\n- `11218 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11218&gt;`_: (This entry is meant to assist plugins which access private pytest internals to instantiate ``FixtureRequest`` objects.)\n\n  :class:`~pytest.FixtureRequest` is now an abstract class which can&#x27;t be instantiated directly.\n  A new concrete ``TopRequest`` subclass of ``FixtureRequest`` has been added for the ``request`` fixture in test functions,\n  as counterpart to the existing ``SubRequest`` subclass for the ``request`` fixture in fixture functions.\n\n\n- `11315 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11315&gt;`_: The :fixture:`pytester` fixture now uses the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture to manage the current working directory.\n  If you use ``pytester`` in combination with :func:`monkeypatch.undo() &lt;pytest.MonkeyPatch.undo&gt;`, the CWD might get restored.\n  Use :func:`monkeypatch.context() &lt;pytest.MonkeyPatch.context&gt;` instead.\n\n\n- `11333 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11333&gt;`_: Corrected the spelling of ``Config.ArgsSource.INVOCATION_DIR``.\n  The previous spelling ``INCOVATION_DIR`` remains as an alias.\n\n\n- `11638 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11638&gt;`_: Fixed the selftests to pass correctly if ``FORCE_COLOR``, ``NO_COLOR`` or ``PY_COLORS`` is set in the calling environment.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.4\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11140 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11140&gt;`_: Fix non-string constants at the top of file being detected as docstrings on Python&gt;=3.8.\n\n\n- `11572 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11572&gt;`_: Handle an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` and :data:`sys.__stderr__` might already be closed when :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.\n\n\n- `11710 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11710&gt;`_: Fixed tracebacks from collection errors not getting pruned.\n\n\n- `7966 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7966&gt;`_: Removed unhelpful error message from assertion rewrite mechanism when exceptions are raised in ``__iter__`` methods. Now they are treated un-iterable instead.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `11091 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11091&gt;`_: Updated documentation to refer to hyphenated options: replaced ``--junitxml`` with ``--junit-xml`` and ``--collectonly`` with ``--collect-only``.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.3\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10447 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10447&gt;`_: Markers are now considered in the reverse mro order to ensure base  class markers are considered first -- this resolves a regression.\n\n\n- `11239 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11239&gt;`_: Fixed ``:=`` in asserts impacting unrelated test cases.\n\n\n- `11439 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11439&gt;`_: Handled an edge case where :data:`sys.stderr` might already be closed when :ref:`faulthandler` is tearing down.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.2\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `11237 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11237&gt;`_: Fix doctest collection of `functools.cached_property` objects.\n\n\n- `11306 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11306&gt;`_: Fixed bug using ``--importmode=importlib`` which would cause package ``__init__.py`` files to be imported more than once in some cases.\n\n\n- `11367 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11367&gt;`_: Fixed bug where `user_properties` where not being saved in the JUnit XML file if a fixture failed during teardown.\n\n\n- `11394 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11394&gt;`_: Fixed crash when parsing long command line arguments that might be interpreted as files.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `11391 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11391&gt;`_: Improved disclaimer on pytest plugin reference page to better indicate this is an automated, non-curated listing.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.1\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10337 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10337&gt;`_: Fixed bug where fake intermediate modules generated by ``--import-mode=importlib`` would not include the\n  child modules as attributes of the parent modules.\n\n\n- `10702 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10702&gt;`_: Fixed error assertion handling in :func:`pytest.approx` when ``None`` is an expected or received value when comparing dictionaries.\n\n\n- `10811 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10811&gt;`_: Fixed issue when using ``--import-mode=importlib`` together with ``--doctest-modules`` that caused modules\n  to be imported more than once, causing problems with modules that have import side effects.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- `10901 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10901&gt;`_: Added :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exception() &lt;pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exception&gt;`, a simpler way to create an :class:`~pytest.ExceptionInfo` from an exception.\n  This can replace :func:`ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info() &lt;pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info()&gt;` for most uses.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `10872 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10872&gt;`_: Update test log report annotation to named tuple and fixed inconsistency in docs for :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook.\n\n\n- `10907 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10907&gt;`_: When an exception traceback to be displayed is completely filtered out (by mechanisms such as ``__tracebackhide__``, internal frames, and similar), now only the exception string and the following message are shown:\n\n  &quot;All traceback entries are hidden. Pass `--full-trace` to see hidden and internal frames.&quot;.\n\n  Previously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.\n\n\n- `10940 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10940&gt;`_: Improved verbose output (``-vv``) of ``skip`` and ``xfail`` reasons by performing text wrapping while leaving a clear margin for progress output.\n\n  Added ``TerminalReporter.wrap_write()`` as a helper for that.\n\n\n- `10991 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991&gt;`_: Added handling of ``%f`` directive to print microseconds in log format options, such as ``log-date-format``.\n\n\n- `11005 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11005&gt;`_: Added the underlying exception to the cache provider&#x27;s path creation and write warning messages.\n\n\n- `11013 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013&gt;`_: Added warning when :confval:`testpaths` is set, but paths are not found by glob. In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the current directory.\n\n\n- `11043 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11043&gt;`_: When `--confcutdir` is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory (`--confcutdir`) is now set to the :ref:`rootdir &lt;rootdir&gt;`.\n  Previously in such cases, `conftest.py` files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.\n  If you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set `--confcutdir`.\n\n\n- `11081 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11081&gt;`_: The :confval:`norecursedirs` check is now performed in a :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` implementation, so plugins can affect it.\n\n  If after updating to this version you see that your `norecursedirs` setting is not being respected,\n  it means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad `pytest_ignore_collect` implementation.\n  Most likely, your hook returns `False` for paths it does not want to ignore,\n  which ends the processing and doesn&#x27;t allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.\n  The fix is to return `None` instead of `False` for paths your hook doesn&#x27;t want to ignore.\n\n\n- `8711 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8711&gt;`_: :func:`caplog.set_level() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level&gt;` and :func:`caplog.at_level() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level&gt;`\n  will temporarily enable the requested ``level`` if ``level`` was disabled globally via\n  ``logging.disable(LEVEL)``.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10831 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10831&gt;`_: Terminal Reporting: Fixed bug when running in ``--tb=line`` mode where ``pytest.fail(pytrace=False)`` tests report ``None``.\n\n\n- `11068 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11068&gt;`_: Fixed the ``--last-failed`` whole-file skipping functionality (&quot;skipped N files&quot;) for :ref:`non-python test files &lt;non-python tests&gt;`.\n\n\n- `11104 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11104&gt;`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.3.2 which caused to :confval:`testpaths` to be considered for loading initial conftests,\n  even when it was not utilized (e.g. when explicit paths were given on the command line).\n  Now the ``testpaths`` are only considered when they are in use.\n\n\n- `1904 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904&gt;`_: Fixed traceback entries hidden with ``__tracebackhide__ = True`` still being shown for chained exceptions (parts after &quot;... the above exception ...&quot; message).\n\n\n- `7781 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7781&gt;`_: Fix writing non-encodable text to log file when using ``--debug``.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `9146 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9146&gt;`_: Improved documentation for :func:`caplog.set_level() &lt;pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level&gt;`.\n\n\n\nTrivial/Internal Changes\n------------------------\n\n- `11031 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11031&gt;`_: Enhanced the CLI flag for ``-c`` to now include ``--config-file`` to make it clear that this flag applies to the usage of a custom config file.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.2\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10169 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10169&gt;`_: Fix bug where very long option names could cause pytest to break with ``OSError: [Errno 36] File name too long`` on some systems.\n\n\n- `10894 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10894&gt;`_: Support for Python 3.12 (beta at the time of writing).\n\n\n- `10987 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10987&gt;`_: :confval:`testpaths` is now honored to load root ``conftests``.\n\n\n- `10999 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10999&gt;`_: The `monkeypatch` `setitem`/`delitem` type annotations now allow `TypedDict` arguments.\n\n\n- `11028 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11028&gt;`_: Fixed bug in assertion rewriting where a variable assigned with the walrus operator could not be used later in a function call.\n\n\n- `11054 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11054&gt;`_: Fixed ``--last-failed``&#x27;s &quot;(skipped N files)&quot; functionality for files inside of packages (directories with `__init__.py` files).\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.1\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `10875 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10875&gt;`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed ``RuntimeError: TestResult has no addDuration method`` when running ``unittest`` tests.\n\n\n- `10890 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10890&gt;`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed ``shutil.rmtree(onerror=...)`` deprecation warning when using :fixture:`tmp_path`.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10896 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10896&gt;`_: Fixed performance regression related to :fixture:`tmp_path` and the new :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` option.\n\n\n- `10903 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10903&gt;`_: Fix crash ``INTERNALERROR IndexError: list index out of range`` which happens when displaying an exception where all entries are hidden.\n  This reverts the change &quot;Correctly handle ``__tracebackhide__`` for chained exceptions.&quot; introduced in version 7.3.0.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\n- `10525 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10525&gt;`_: Test methods decorated with ``classmethod`` can now be discovered as tests, following the same rules as normal methods. This fills the gap that static methods were discoverable as tests but not class methods.\n\n\n- `10755 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10755&gt;`_: :confval:`console_output_style` now supports ``progress-even-when-capture-no`` to force the use of the progress output even when capture is disabled. This is useful in large test suites where capture may have significant performance impact.\n\n\n- `7431 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7431&gt;`_: ``--log-disable`` CLI option added to disable individual loggers.\n\n\n- `8141 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8141&gt;`_: Added :confval:`tmp_path_retention_count` and :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` configuration options to control how directories created by the :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture are kept.\n\n\n\nImprovements\n------------\n\n- `10226 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10226&gt;`_: If multiple errors are raised in teardown, we now re-raise an ``ExceptionGroup`` of them instead of discarding all but the last.\n\n\n- `10658 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10658&gt;`_: Allow ``-p`` arguments to include spaces (eg: ``-p no:logging`` instead of\n  ``-pno:logging``). Mostly useful in the ``addopts`` section of the configuration\n  file.\n\n\n- `10710 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10710&gt;`_: Added ``start`` and ``stop`` timestamps to ``TestReport`` objects.\n\n\n- `10727 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10727&gt;`_: Split the report header for ``rootdir``, ``config file`` and ``testpaths`` so each has its own line.\n\n\n- `10840 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10840&gt;`_: pytest should no longer crash on AST with pathological position attributes, for example testing AST produced by `Hylang &lt;https://github.com/hylang/hy&gt;__`.\n\n\n- `6267 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6267&gt;`_: The full output of a test is no longer truncated if the truncation message would be longer than\n  the hidden text. The line number shown has also been fixed.\n\n\n\nBug Fixes\n---------\n\n- `10743 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10743&gt;`_: The assertion rewriting mechanism now works correctly when assertion expressions contain the walrus operator.\n\n\n- `10765 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10765&gt;`_: Fixed :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture always raising :class:`OSError` on ``emscripten`` platform due to missing :func:`os.getuid`.\n\n\n- `1904 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904&gt;`_: Correctly handle ``__tracebackhide__`` for chained exceptions.\n  NOTE: This change was reverted in version 7.3.1.\n\n\n\nImproved Documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `10782 &lt;https://github.com/pytest", "created_at": "2024-07-21T08:45:21Z", "updated_at":

This enables many interesting exclusion use-cases, including those\n  requested in issues `118 &lt;issue 118_&gt;`_ (entire files), `996\n  &lt;issue 996_&gt;`_ (multiple lines only when appearing together), `1741\n  &lt;issue 1741_&gt;`_ (remainder of a function), and `1803 &lt;issue 1803_&gt;`_\n  (arbitrary sequence of marked lines).  See the :ref:`multi_line_exclude`\n  section of the docs for more details and examples.\n\n- The JSON report now includes per-function and per-class coverage information.\n  Thanks to `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1809_&gt;`_ for getting the work started. This\n  closes `issue 1793`_ and `issue 1532`_.\n\n- Fixed an incorrect calculation of &quot;(no class)&quot; lines in the HTML classes\n  report.\n\n- Python 3.13.0b3 is supported.\n\n.. _issue 118: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/118\n.. _issue 996: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/996\n.. _issue 1532: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1532\n.. _issue 1741: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1741\n.. _issue 1793: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1793\n.. _issue 1803: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1803\n.. _pull 1807: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1807\n.. _pull 1809: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1809\n\n.. _changes_7-5-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch coverage data,\n  coverage.py used to fail with the message &quot;Can&#x27;t combine arc data with line\n  data&quot; or its reverse, &quot;Can&#x27;t combine line data with arc data.&quot;  These\n  messages used internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand\n  the problem.  They are now changed to mention &quot;branch coverage data&quot; and\n  &quot;statement coverage data.&quot;\n\n- Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard match/case cases using\n  names or guard clauses.\n\n- Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python.  I&#x27;m not\n  claiming full support yet.  Closes `issue 1799`_.\n\n.. _issue 1799: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1799\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Performance improvements for combining data files, especially when measuring\n  line coverage. A few different quadratic behaviors were eliminated. In one\n  extreme case of combining 700+ data files, the time dropped from more than\n  three hours to seven minutes.  Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the fix.\n\n- Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a side benefit of\n  reducing memory use, closing `issue 1791`_.  Thanks to Daniel Diniz for\n  helping to diagnose the problem.\n\n.. _issue 1791: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1791\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as\n  reported in `issue 1779`_.  This is now fixed.\n\n- Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an\n  executable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not\n  executable if it was the first line.  Now module docstrings are never counted\n  as executable statements.  This can change coverage.py&#x27;s count of the number\n  of statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage\n  reported.\n\n- In the HTML report, the filter term and &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox settings are\n  remembered between viewings, thanks to `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1776_&gt;`_.\n\n- Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.\n\n- Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are\n  handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to `Liam DeVoe\n  &lt;pull 1788_&gt;`_. Closes `issue 1787`_.\n\n.. _pull 1776: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1776\n.. _issue 1779: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1779\n.. _issue 1787: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1787\n.. _pull 1788: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1788\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement\n  now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is\n  on the first line. This closes `issue 754`_. The fix was contributed by\n  `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1773_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: very complex source files like `this one &lt;resolvent_lookup_&gt;`_ could\n  cause a maximum recursion error when creating an HTML report.  This is now\n  fixed, closing `issue 1774`_.\n\n- HTML report improvements:\n\n  - Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have\n    hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of\n    stale cached copies.\n\n  - Missing branch coverage explanations that said &quot;the condition was never\n    false&quot; now read &quot;the condition was always true&quot; because it&#x27;s easier to\n    understand.\n\n  - Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index pages,\n    fixing `issue 1766`_.  Thanks, `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1768_&gt;`_.\n\n\n.. _resolvent_lookup: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/130950f3e6b3f97fcc17f4599ac08f70fdd2e9d4/sympy/polys/numberfields/resolvent_lookup.py\n.. _issue 754: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/754\n.. _issue 1766: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1766\n.. _pull 1768: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1768\n.. _pull 1773: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1773\n.. _issue 1774: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1774\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report.\n  There are now three index pages which link to each other: files, functions,\n  and classes.  Other reports don&#x27;t yet have this information, but it will be\n  added in the future where it makes sense.  Feedback gladly accepted!\n  Finishes `issue 780`_.\n\n- Other HTML report improvements:\n\n  - There is now a &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox to filter out 100% files, finishing\n    `issue 1384`_.\n\n  - The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer\n    indications of the sorting.\n\n  - The &quot;previous file&quot; shortcut key didn&#x27;t work on the index page, but now it\n    does, fixing `issue 1765`_.\n\n- The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows\n  absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren&#x27;t taking effect,\n  and is renamed from &quot;attempted_config_files&quot; to the more logical\n  &quot;config_files_attempted.&quot;\n\n- Python 3.13.0a6 is supported.\n\n.. _issue 780: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/780\n.. _issue 1384: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1384\n.. _issue 1765: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1765\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: in some cases, even with ``[run] relative_files=True``, a data file\n  could be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other relative\n  data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made\n  relative or not. If they weren&#x27;t, then a file would be listed twice in\n  reports, as detailed in `issue 1752`_.  This is now fixed: absolute file\n  names are always made relative when combining.  Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos\n  Santos for support.\n\n- Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the\n  branch was missed.  It said the pattern never matched, when actually the\n  branch is missed if the last case always matched.\n\n- Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.\n\n- Fix: the ``report:format`` setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a\n  string.  Thanks, `Tanaydin Sirin &lt;pull 1754_&gt;`_.  It is also now documented\n  on the :ref:`configuration page &lt;config_report_format&gt;`.\n\n.. _issue 1752: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752\n.. _pull 1754: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: &quot;Set changed\n  size during iteration.&quot; This is now fixed, closing `issue 1733`_.\n\n.. _issue 1733: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: setting ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` no longer errors on 3.11 and lower,\n  thanks `Hugo van Kemenade &lt;pull 1747_&gt;`_.  It now issues a warning that\n  sys.monitoring is not available and falls back to the default core instead.\n\n.. _pull 1747: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1747\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Python 3.13.0a3 is supported.\n\n- Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number, closing\n  `issue 1732`_.\n\n.. _issue 1732: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1732\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new\n  :mod:`sys.monitoring &lt;python:sys.monitoring&gt;` module by defining a\n  ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` environment variable.  This should be faster for\n  line coverage, but not for branch coverage, and plugins and dynamic contexts\n  are not yet supported with it.  I am very interested to hear how it works (or\n  doesn&#x27;t!) for you.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other\n  forms of nested clauses being excluded properly.  This is now fixed, closing\n  `issue 1713`_.\n\n- Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won&#x27;t select the line\n  numbers also. Thanks, `Robert Harris &lt;pull 1717_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1713: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1713\n.. _pull 1717: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1717\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded by\n  matching any of the lines, closing `issue 684`_.  Thanks, `Jan Rusak,\n  Maciej Kowalczyk and Joanna Ejzel &lt;pull 1705_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric components\n  that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like ``file1.py`` and\n  ``file001.py``.  Fixes `issue 1709`_.\n\n- The ``coverage annotate`` command used to announce that it would be removed\n  in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it, so\n  it will stay.  Don&#x27;t expect it to keep up with other new features though.\n\n- Added new :ref:`debug options &lt;cmd_run_debug&gt;`:\n\n  - ``pytest`` writes the pytest test name into the debug output.\n\n  - ``dataop2`` writes the full data being added to CoverageData objects.\n\n.. _issue 684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/684\n.. _pull 1705: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1705\n.. _issue 1709: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1709\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- The ``coverage lcov`` command ignored the ``[report] exclude_lines`` and\n  ``[report] exclude_also`` settings (`issue 1684`_).  This is now fixed,\n  thanks `Jacqueline Lee &lt;pull 1685_&gt;`_.\n\n- Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database\n  files.  These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining\n  data files.  Now they are always ignored, fixing `issue 1605`_. Thanks to\n  Brad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.\n\n- On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be\n  a little faster.\n\n- The new 3.12 soft keyword ``type`` is properly bolded in HTML reports.\n\n- Removed the &quot;fullcoverage&quot; feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of\n  early-imported standard library modules.  CPython `stopped using it\n  &lt;88054_&gt;`_ in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.\n\n.. _issue 1605: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605\n.. _issue 1684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684\n.. _pull 1685: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685\n.. _88054: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in the docs.  A\n  leading or trailing star matches any number of path components, like a double\n  star would.  This is different than the behavior of a star in the middle of a\n  pattern.  This discrepancy was `identified by Sviatoslav Sydorenko\n  &lt;starbad_&gt;`_, who `provided patient detailed diagnosis &lt;pull 1650_&gt;`_ and\n  graciously agreed to a pragmatic resolution.\n\n- The API docs were missing from the last version. They are now `restored\n  &lt;apidocs_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _apidocs: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_coverage.html\n.. _starbad: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407#issuecomment-1631085209\n.. _pull 1650: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1650\n\n.. _changes_7-3-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added a :meth:`.Coverage.collect` context manager to start and stop coverage\n  data collection.\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.7.\n\n- Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to asynchronous mode.\n  Coverage.py would fail with the error ``Safety level may not be changed\n  inside a transaction.`` This is now avoided, closing `issue 1646`_.  Thanks\n  to Michael Bell for the detailed bug report.\n\n- Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate examples for the\n  different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, and tox.ini.\n\n- Fix: added ``nosemgrep`` comments to our JavaScript code so that\n  semgrep-based SAST security checks won&#x27;t raise false alarms about security\n  problems that aren&#x27;t problems.\n\n- Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to `Ken Schackart &lt;pull 1641_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _pull 1641: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1641\n.. _issue 1646: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1646\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-7:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.7\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: reverted a `change from 6.4.3 &lt;pull 1347b_&gt;`_ that helped Cython, but\n  also increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as\n  described in the now-fixed `issue 1586`_. The problem is now avoided due to a\n  recent change (`issue 1538 &lt;issue 1538b_&gt;`_).  Thanks to `Anders Kaseorg\n  &lt;pull 1629_&gt;`_ and David Szotten for persisting with problem reports and\n  detailed diagnoses.\n\n- Wheels are now provided for CPython 3.12.\n\n.. _pull 1347b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347\n.. _issue 1538b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538\n.. _issue 1586: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1586\n.. _pull 1629: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1629\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-6:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.6\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: the ``lcov`` command could raise an IndexError exception if a file is\n  translated to Python but then executed under its own name.  Jinja2 does this\n  when rendering templates.  Fixes `issue 1553`_.\n\n- Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions.  Previously they were compiled\n  as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn you if they weren&#x27;t\n  completely executed.  This no longer happens under Python 3.12.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage debug sys`` command includes some environment variables\n  in its output.  This could have included sensitive data.  Those values are\n  now hidden with asterisks, closing `issue 1628`_.\n\n.. _issue 1553: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1553\n.. _issue 1628: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1628\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-5:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.5\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: ``html_report()`` could fail with an AttributeError on ``isatty`` if run\n  in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced.  This is now\n  fixed.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nPyCon 2023 sprint fixes!\n\n- Fix: with ``relative_files = true``, specifying a specific file to include or\n  omit wouldn&#x27;t work correctly (`issue 1604`_).  This is now fixed, with\n  testing help by `Marc Gibbons &lt;pull 1608_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect ``&lt;source&gt;`` element when using\n  relative files and the source option ended with a slash (`issue 1541`_).\n  This is now fixed, thanks to `Kevin Brown-Silva &lt;pull 1608_&gt;`_.\n\n- When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it&#x27;s now a\n  terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to open the HTML\n  file in your browser.  Finishes `issue 1523`_ thanks to `Ricardo Newbery\n  &lt;pull 1613_&gt;`_.\n\n- Docs: a new :ref:`Migrating page &lt;migrating&gt;` with details about how to\n  migrate between major versions of coverage.py.  It currently covers the\n  wildcard changes in 7.x.

This was\n  fixed thanks to `Lewis Gaul &lt;pull 1600_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1599`_.\n\n- Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much more compact.\n  File sizes are typically as small as one-third the previous size, but can be\n  dramatically smaller. This closes `issue 1584`_ thanks to `Oleh Krehel\n  &lt;pull 1587_&gt;`_.\n\n- Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing `issue 1592`_.\n\n.. _issue 1584: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1584\n.. _pull 1587: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1587\n.. _issue 1592: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1592\n.. _issue 1599: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1599\n.. _pull 1600: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1600\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: if a virtualenv was created inside a source directory, and a sourced\n  package was installed inside the virtualenv, then all of the third-party\n  packages inside the virtualenv would be measured.  This was incorrect, but\n  has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be measured, thanks to\n  `Manuel Jacob &lt;pull 1560_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` command could create a .lcov file with incorrect\n  LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Ian Moore &lt;pull 1583_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage xml`` command on Windows could create a .xml file with\n  duplicate ``&lt;package&gt;`` elements. This is now fixed, thanks to `Benjamin\n  Parzella &lt;pull 1574_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1573`_.\n\n.. _pull 1560: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1560\n.. _issue 1573: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1573\n.. _pull 1574: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1574\n.. _pull 1583: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1583\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages, but no longer\n  does, closing `issue 1566`_.\n\n- Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly indicated so that\n  mypy will find them, fixing `issue 1564`_.\n\n.. _issue 1564: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1564\n.. _issue 1566: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1566\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added a new setting ``[report] exclude_also`` to let you add more exclusions\n  without overwriting the defaults.  Thanks, `Alpha Chen &lt;pull 1557_&gt;`_,\n  closing `issue 1391`_.\n\n- Added a :meth:`.CoverageData.purge_files` method to remove recorded data for\n  a particular file.  Contributed by `Stephan Deibel &lt;pull 1547_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer congratulate\n  themselves with messages like &quot;Wrote XML report to file.xml&quot; before spewing a\n  traceback about their failure.\n\n- Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now accept pathlib.Path\n  objects.  This includes the ``data_file`` and ``config_file`` arguments to\n  the Coverage constructor and the ``basename`` argument to CoverageData.\n  Closes `issue 1552`_.\n\n- Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur on stop() when\n  the originating thread exits before completion.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Russell Keith-Magee &lt;pull 1543_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1542`_.\n\n- Added a ``py.typed`` file to announce our type-hintedness.  Thanks,\n  `KotlinIsland &lt;pull 1550_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1391: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1391\n.. _issue 1542: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1542\n.. _pull 1543: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1543\n.. _pull 1547: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1547\n.. _pull 1550: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1550\n.. _issue 1552: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1552\n.. _pull 1557: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1557\n\n\n.. _changes_7-1-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.1.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added: the debug output file can now be specified with ``[run] debug_file``\n  in the configuration file.  Closes `issue 1319`_.\n\n- Performance: fixed a slowdown with dynamic contexts that&#x27;s been around since\n  6.4.3.  The fix closes `issue 1538`_.  Thankfully this doesn&#x27;t break the\n  `Cython change`_ that fixed `issue 972`_.  Thanks to Mathieu Kniewallner for\n  the deep investigative work and comprehensive issue report.\n\n- Typing: all product and test code has type annotations.\n\n.. _Cython change: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347\n.. _issue 972: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972\n.. _issue 1319: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1319\n.. _issue 1538: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-5:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.5\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: On Python 3.7, a file with type annotations but no ``from __future__\n  import annotations`` would be missing statements in the coverage report. This\n  is now fixed, closing `issue 1524`_.\n\n.. _issue 1524: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1524\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Performance: an internal cache of file names was accidentally disabled,\n  resulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance.  This is now fixed,\n  closing `issue 1527`_.   Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test\n  case.\n\n.. _issue 1527: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining\n  step could fail with ``assert row is not None`` using 7.0.2.  This was due to\n  a race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In\n  7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.\n  Now it will produce a message &quot;Couldn&#x27;t combine data file&quot; and ignore the\n  data file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes `issue 1522`_.\n\n.. _issue 1522: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: when using the ``[run] relative_files = True`` setting, a relative\n  ``[paths]`` pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\n  closing `issue 1519`_.\n\n- Fix: if Python doesn&#x27;t provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\n  only be read if coverage.py is installed with the ``[toml]`` extra.\n  Coverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees\n  your settings are in a .toml file. But it didn&#x27;t understand that\n  ``[tools.coverage]`` was a valid section header, so the error wasn&#x27;t reported\n  if you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now\n  fixed, closing `issue 1516`_.\n\n- Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing `issue 1515`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` report did not properly implement the\n  ``--fail-under=MIN`` option.  This has been fixed.\n\n- Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.\n  This should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some\n  places, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.\n\n- Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and\n  IronPython.\n\n.. _issue 1515: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515\n.. _issue 1516: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516\n.. _issue 1519: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists, we weren&#x27;t\n  considering files in .whl files.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1511`_.\n\n- File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and curly braces in\n  directory and file names.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1513`_.\n\n- Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could prevent\n  reporting.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1512`_.\n\n- The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing `issue 1510`_.\n\n.. _issue 1510: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1510\n.. _issue 1511: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1511\n.. _issue 1512: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1512\n.. _issue 1513: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1513\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nNothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-0b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.0b1\n   ```\n   ----------------------------\n\nA number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern\nmatching and path remapping with the ``[paths]`` setting (see\n:ref:`config_paths`).  These changes might affect you, and require you to\nupdate your settings.\n\n(This release includes the changes from `6.6.0b1`__, since 6.6.0 was never\nreleased.)\n\n__ https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-6-6-0b1\n\n- Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your\n  configuration:\n\n  - Previously, ``*`` would incorrectly match directory separators, making\n    precise matching difficult.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1407`_.\n\n  - Now ``**`` matches any number of nested directories, including none.\n\n- Improvements to combining data files when using the\n  :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting, which might require updating your\n  configuration:\n\n  - During ``coverage combine``, relative file paths are implicitly combined\n    without needing a ``[paths]`` configuration setting.  This also fixed\n    `issue 991`_.\n\n  - A ``[paths]`` setting like ``*/foo`` will now match ``foo/bar.py`` so that\n    relative file paths can be combined more easily.\n\n  - The :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting is properly interpreted in\n    more places, fixing `issue 1280`_.\n\n- When remapping file paths with ``[paths]``, a path will be remapped only if\n  the resulting path exists.  The documentation has long said the prefix had to\n  exist, but it was never enforced.  This fixes `issue 608`_, improves `issue\n  649`_, and closes `issue 757`_.\n\n- Reporting operations now implicitly use the ``[paths]`` setting to remap file\n  paths within a single data file.  Combining multiple files still requires the\n  ``coverage combine`` step, but this simplifies some single-file situations.\n  Closes `issue 1212`_ and `issue 713`_.\n\n- The ``coverage report`` command now has a ``--format=`` option.  The original\n  style is now ``--format=text``, and is the default.\n\n  - Using ``--format=markdown`` will write the table in Markdown format, thanks\n    to `Steve Oswald &lt;pull 1479_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1418`_.\n\n  - Using ``--format=total`` will write a single total number to the\n    output.  This can be useful for making badges or writing status updates.\n\n- Combining data files with ``coverage combine`` now hashes the data files to\n  skip files that add no new information.  This can reduce the time needed.\n  Many details affect the speed-up, but for coverage.py&#x27;s own test suite,\n  combining is about 40% faster. Closes `issue 1483`_.\n\n- When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py uses the\n  presence of ``__init__.py`` files to determine which directories have source\n  that could have been imported.  However, `implicit namespace packages`_ don&#x27;t\n  require ``__init__.py``.  A new setting ``[report]\n  include_namespace_packages`` tells coverage.py to consider these directories\n  during reporting.  Thanks to `Felix Horvat &lt;pull 1387_&gt;`_ for the\n  contribution.  Closes `issue 1383`_ and `issue 1024`_.\n\n- Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files.  It was overly\n  broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in `issue\n  1481`_ and `issue 1345`_.  This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require\n  changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment\n  substitution.\n\n- An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail with\n  ``--fail-under``.  This has been fixed, closing `issue 1470`_.\n\n- The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines if there are\n  no files listed in the table.  One is plenty.\n\n- Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard alternatives in\n  match/case statements, closing `issue 1421`_.\n\n- Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on\n  implementations other than CPython or PyPy (`issue 1474`_).\n\n- The deprecated ``[run] note`` setting has been completely removed.\n\n.. _implicit namespace packages: https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/\n.. _issue 608: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/608\n.. _issue 649: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/649\n.. _issue 713: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/713\n.. _issue 757: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/757\n.. _issue 991: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991\n.. _issue 1024: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1024\n.. _issue 1212: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1212\n.. _issue 1280: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280\n.. _issue 1345: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345\n.. _issue 1383: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1383\n.. _issue 1407: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407\n.. _issue 1418: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1418\n.. _issue 1421: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1421\n.. _issue 1470: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1470\n.. _issue 1474: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474\n.. _issue 1481: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481\n.. _issue 1483: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1483\n.. _pull 1387: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1387\n.. _pull 1479: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1479\n\n\n.. _changes_6-6-0b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.6.0b1\n   ```\n   ----------------------------\n\n(Note: 6.6.0 final was never released. These changes are part of `7.0.0b1`__.)\n\n__ https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-7-0-0b1\n\n- Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your\n  configuration:\n\n  - Previously, ``*`` would incorrectly match directory separators, making\n    precise matching difficult.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1407`_.\n\n  - Now ``**`` matches any number of nested directories, including none.\n\n- Improvements to combining data files when using the\n  :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting:\n\n  - During ``coverage combine``, relative file paths are implicitly combined\n    without needing a ``[paths]`` configuration setting.  This also fixed\n    `issue 991`_.\n\n  - A ``[paths]`` setting like ``*/foo`` will now match ``foo/bar.py`` so that\n    relative file paths can be combined more easily.\n\n  - The setting is properly interpreted in more places, fixing `issue 1280`_.\n\n- Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files.  It was overly\n  broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in `issue\n  1481`_ and `issue 1345`_.  This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require\n  changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment\n  substitution.\n\n- Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on\n  implementations other than CPython or PyPy (`issue 1474`_).\n\n.. _issue 991: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991\n.. _issue 1280: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280\n.. _issue 1345: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345\n.. _issue 1407: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407\n.. _issue 1474: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474\n.. _issue 1481: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481\n\n\n.. _changes_6-5-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.5.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which\n  are missing for each file. Thanks, `Christoph Blessing &lt;pull 1438_&gt;`_. Closes\n  `issue 1425`_.\n\n- Starting with coverage.py 6.2, ``class`` statements were marked as a branch.\n  This wasn&#x27;t right, and has been reverted, fixing `issue 1449`_. Note this\n  will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch\n  coverage.\n\n- Packaging is now compliant with `PEP 517`_, closing `issue 1395`_.\n\n- A new debug option ``--debug=pathmap`` shows details of the remapping of\n  paths that happens during combine due to the ``[paths]`` setting.\n\n- Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing.

Thanks, `Michael Krebs and Benjamin Schubert &lt;pull 1405_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different\n  drive than the current directory, closing `issue 1428`_.  Thanks, `Lorenzo\n  Mic\u00f2 &lt;pull 1430_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in\n  a Docker container. Thanks `Arthur Rio &lt;pull 1403_&gt;`_.\n\n- Filtering in the HTML report wouldn&#x27;t work when reloading the index page.\n  This is now fixed.  Thanks, `Marc Legendre &lt;pull 1413_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix a problem with Cython code measurement, closing `issue 972`_.

This line cannot be executed, so\n  coverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,\n  but this also means that truly empty modules (like ``__init__.py``) have no\n  lines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes `issue 1419`_.\n\n- Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to\n  avoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.  Thanks,\n  `Yilei Yang &lt;pull 1399_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1419: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1419\n.. _pull 1399: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1399\n\n\n.. _changes_6-4-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.4.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that need the\n  pure Python trace function.  Thanks, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick (`pull\n  1381`_ and `pull 1388`_).  Slightly improved performance when using the C\n  trace function, as most environments do.  Closes `issue 1339`_.\n\n- The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have been made\n  more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to work. Closes `issue\n  1390`_.\n\n.. _issue 1339: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1339\n.. _pull 1381: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1381\n.. _pull 1388: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1388\n.. _issue 1390: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1390\n\n\n.. _changes_64:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.4\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- A new setting, :ref:`config_run_sigterm`, controls whether a SIGTERM signal\n  handler is used.  In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed, to capture\n  data at unusual process ends.  Unfortunately, this introduced other problems\n  (see `issue 1310`_).  Now the signal handler is only used if you opt-in by\n  setting ``[run] sigterm = true``.\n\n- Small changes to the HTML report:\n\n  - Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard shortcuts: ``[``\n    and ``]`` for next file and previous file; ``u`` for up to the index; and\n    ``?`` to open/close the help panel.  Thanks, `J. M. F. Tsang\n    &lt;pull 1364_&gt;`_.\n\n  - The time stamp and version are displayed at the top of the report.  Thanks,\n    `Ammar Askar &lt;pull 1354_&gt;`_. Closes `issue 1351`_.\n\n- A new debug option ``debug=sqldata`` adds more detail to ``debug=sql``,\n  logging all the data being written to the database.\n\n- Previously, running ``coverage report`` (or any of the reporting commands) in\n  an empty directory would create a .coverage data file.  Now they do not,\n  fixing `issue 1328`_.\n\n- On Python 3.11, the ``[toml]`` extra no longer installs tomli, instead using\n  tomllib from the standard library.  Thanks `Shantanu &lt;pull 1359_&gt;`_.\n\n- In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing `issue 1323`_.\n\n.. _issue 1310: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310\n.. _issue 1323: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1323\n.. _issue 1328: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1328\n.. _issue 1351: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1351\n.. _pull 1354: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1354\n.. _pull 1359: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1359\n.. _pull 1364: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1364\n\n\n.. _changes_633:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: Coverage.py now builds successfully on CPython 3.11 (3.11.0b1) again.\n  Closes `issue 1367`_.  Some results for generators may have changed.\n\n.. _issue 1367: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1367\n\n\n.. _changes_632:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: adapt to pypy3.9&#x27;s decorator tracing behavior.  It now traces function\n  decorators like CPython 3.8: both the -line and the def-line are traced.\n  Fixes `issue 1326`_.\n\n- Debug: added ``pybehave`` to the list of :ref:`coverage debug &lt;cmd_debug&gt;`\n  and :ref:`cmd_run_debug` options.\n\n- Fix: show an intelligible error message if ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``\n  is used without a configuration file.  Closes `issue 1320`_.\n\n.. _issue 1320: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1320\n.. _issue 1326: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1326\n\n\n.. _changes_631:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes.  Some of these\n  deadlocks (described in `issue 1310`_) are now fixed.\n\n- Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing an error:\n  &quot;ValueError: signal only works in main thread&quot;.  This is now fixed, closing\n  `issue 1312`_.\n\n- Fix: ``--precision`` on the command-line was being ignored while considering\n  ``--fail-under``.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Marcelo Trylesinski &lt;pull 1317_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py uses CPython\n  internal fields which are moving during the alpha phase. Fixes `issue 1316`_.\n\n.. _issue 1310: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310\n.. _issue 1312: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1312\n.. _issue 1316: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1316\n.. _pull 1317: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1317\n\n\n.. _changes_63:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Feature: Added the ``lcov`` command to generate reports in LCOV format.\n  Thanks, `Bradley Burns &lt;pull 1289_&gt;`_. Closes issues `587 &lt;issue 587_&gt;`_\n  and `626 &lt;issue 626_&gt;`_.\n\n- Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the command line with\n  the ``--data-file`` option in any command that reads or writes data.  This is\n  in addition to the existing ``COVERAGE_FILE`` environment variable.  Closes\n  `issue 624`_. Thanks, `Nikita Bloshchanevich &lt;pull 1304_&gt;`_.\n\n- Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a SIGTERM signal\n  is received by the process.  This includes\n  :meth:`Process.terminate &lt;python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate&gt;`,\n  and other ways to terminate a process.  Currently this is only on Linux and\n  Mac; Windows is not supported.  Fixes `issue 1307`_.\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on 2021-12-23.\n\n- Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing `issue 1294`_.\n\n- Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way, to avoid\n  problems when multiple processes are trying to write data at once. Fixes\n  issues `1303 &lt;issue 1303_&gt;`_ and `883 &lt;issue 883_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report output\n  directory if the directory is empty.  This should prevent certain unfortunate\n  accidents of writing the file where it is not wanted.\n\n- Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing `issue 1288`_.\n\n.. _issue 587: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/587\n.. _issue 624: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/624\n.. _issue 626: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/626\n.. _issue 883: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/883\n.. _issue 1288: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1288\n.. _issue 1294: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1294\n.. _issue 1303: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1303\n.. _issue 1307: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1307\n.. _pull 1289: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1289\n.. _pull 1304: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1304\n\n\n.. _changes_62:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.2\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Feature: Now the ``--concurrency`` setting can have a list of values, so that\n  threads and another lightweight threading package can be measured together,\n  such as ``--concurrency=gevent,thread``.  Closes `issue 1012`_ and `issue\n  1082`_.  This also means that ``thread`` must be explicitly specified in some\n  cases that used to be implicit such as ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,\n  which must be changed to ``--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread``.\n\n- Fix: A module specified as the ``source`` setting is imported during startup,\n  before the user program imports it.  This could cause problems if the rest of\n  the program isn&#x27;t ready yet.  For example, `issue 1203`_ describes a Django\n  setting that is accessed before settings have been configured.  Now the early\n  import is wrapped in a try/except so errors then don&#x27;t stop execution.\n\n- Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion to end too\n  early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated function. This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file that already\n  exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for `issue 1244\n  &lt;issue 1244b_&gt;`_).\n\n- API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been specialized, to provide\n  finer-grained catching of exceptions by third-party code.\n\n- API: Using ``suffix=False`` when constructing a Coverage object with\n  multiprocessing wouldn&#x27;t suppress the data file suffix (`issue 989`_).  This\n  is now fixed.\n\n- Debug: The ``coverage debug data`` command will now sniff out combinable data\n  files, and report on all of them.\n\n- Debug: The ``coverage debug`` command used to accept a number of topics at a\n  time, and show all of them, though this was never documented.  This no longer\n  works, to allow for command-line options in the future.\n\n.. _issue 989: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/989\n.. _issue 1012: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1012\n.. _issue 1082: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1082\n.. _issue 1203: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1203\n.. _issue 1244b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244\n\n\n.. _changes_612:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2).  One still-open issue has to\n  do with `exits through with-statements &lt;issue 1270_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: When remapping file paths through the ``[paths]`` setting while\n  combining, the ``[run] relative_files`` setting was ignored, resulting in\n  absolute paths for remapped file names (`issue 1147`_).  This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have incorrectly reported\n  a missing branch (`issue 1271`_). This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse source files for\n  reporting.  Problems that used to terminate coverage.py can now be handled\n  with ``[report] ignore_errors``.  This helps with plugins failing to read\n  files (`django_coverage_plugin issue 78`_).\n\n- Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball\n  (`issue 840 &lt;issue 840b_&gt;`_).\n\n- Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an internal class.\n  This unsupported class is being used by coveralls (`issue 1273`_). Although\n  I&#x27;d rather not &quot;fix&quot; unsupported interfaces, it&#x27;s actually nicer with a\n  default value.\n\n.. _django_coverage_plugin issue 78: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/78\n.. _issue 840b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840\n.. _issue 1147: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1147\n.. _issue 1270: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1270\n.. _issue 1271: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1271\n.. _issue 1273: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1273\n\n\n.. _changes_611:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn&#x27;t work unless you had branch\n  coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky header works for everyone.\n  (Do people still use coverage without branch measurement!? j/k)\n\n- Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the &quot;already imported\n  a file that will be measured&quot; warning would be issued (`issue 888`_).  This\n  is now fixed.\n\n.. _issue 888: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/888\n\n\n.. _changes_61:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Deprecated: The ``annotate`` command and the ``Coverage.annotate`` function\n  will be removed in a future version, unless people let me know that they are\n  using it.  Instead, the ``html`` command gives better-looking (and more\n  accurate) output, and the ``report -m`` command will tell you line numbers of\n  missing lines.  Please get in touch if you have a reason to use ``annotate``\n  over those better options: nednedbatchelder.com.\n\n- Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable, ``COVERAGE_RUN`` when\n  running your code with the ``coverage run`` command.  The value is not\n  important, and may change in the future.  Closes `issue 553`_.\n\n- Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have a sticky\n  header so the file name and controls are always visible.\n\n- Feature: The ``xml`` and ``json`` commands now describe what they wrote\n  where.\n\n- Feature: The ``html``, ``combine``, ``xml``, and ``json`` commands all accept\n  a ``-q/--quiet`` option to suppress the messages they write to stdout about\n  what they are doing (`issue 1254`_).\n\n- Feature: The ``html`` command writes a ``.gitignore`` file into the HTML\n  output directory, to prevent the report from being committed to git.  If you\n  want to commit it, you will need to delete that file.  Closes `issue 1244`_.\n\n- Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.\n\n- Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement.  Code such as\n  `attrs`_ boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured though the\n  synthetic line numbers meant they were never reported.  Once Cython was\n  involved though, the generated .so files were parsed as Python, raising\n  syntax errors, as reported in `issue 1160`_.  This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are sorted\n  correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py.  This applies to file names,\n  module names, environment variables, and test contexts.\n\n- Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you might only\n  notice on code that is executed many times, such as long-running loops.\n\n- Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored (`issue 840`_ and `issue 1118`_).\n  Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the conversion to vanilla\n  JavaScript in `pull request 1248`_.\n\n.. _issue 553: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/553\n.. _issue 840: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840\n.. _issue 1118: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1118\n.. _issue 1160: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1160\n.. _issue 1244: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244\n.. _pull request 1248: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1248\n.. _issue 1254: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1254\n.. _attrs: https://www.attrs.org/\n\n\n.. _changes_602:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Namespace packages being measured weren&#x27;t properly handled by the new code\n  that ignores third-party packages. If the namespace package was installed, it\n  was ignored as a third-party package.  That problem (`issue 1231`_) is now\n  fixed.\n\n- Packages named as &quot;source packages&quot; (with ``source``, or ``source_pkgs``, or\n  pytest-cov&#x27;s ``--cov``) might have been only partially measured.  Their\n  top-level statements could be marked as un-executed, because they were\n  imported by coverage.py before measurement began (`issue 1232`_).  This is\n  now fixed, but the package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then\n  again by your test suite.  This could cause problems if importing the package\n  has side effects.\n\n- The :meth:`.CoverageData.contexts_by_lineno` method was documented to return\n  a dict, but was returning a defaultdict.  Now it returns a plain dict.  It\n  also no longer returns negative numbered keys.\n\n.. _issue 1231: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1231\n.. _issue 1232: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1232\n\n\n.. _changes_601:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to\n  coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the public supported\n  API, CoverageException is. But a number of other third-party packages were\n  importing the exceptions from coverage.misc, so they are now available from\n  there again (`issue 1226`_).\n\n- Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that tomli can use\n  coverage.py for their own test suite (`issue 1228`_).\n\n- Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation, where a\n  function can have an argument called &quot;self&quot;, but no local named &quot;self&quot;\n  (`pull request 1210`_).  Thanks, Ben Carlsson.\n\n.. _pull request 1210: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1210\n.. _issue 1226: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1226\n.. _issue 1228: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1228\n\n\n.. _changes_60:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The ``coverage html`` command now prints a message indicating where the HTML\n  report was written.  Fixes `issue 1195`_.\n\n- The ``coverage combine`` command now prints messages indicating each data\n  file being combined.  Fixes `issue 1105`_.\n\n- The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due to\n  ``skip_covered`` or ``skip_empty`` settings.  Fixes `issue 1163`_.\n\n- Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer errors. They are\n  now warnings, to ease the use of coverage across versions.  Fixes `issue\n  1035`_.\n\n- Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python 3.10. A missing\n  exception is no longer considered a missing branch from the with statement.\n  Fixes `issue 1205`_.\n\n- Fix another rarer instance of &quot;Error binding parameter 0 - probably\n  unsupported type.&quot; (`issue 1010 &lt;issue 1010b_&gt;`_).\n\n- Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer against\n  conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously (`pull 1220`_).\n  Thanks, Cl\u00e9ment Pit-Claudel.\n\n.. _issue 1010b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\n.. _issue 1035: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1035\n.. _issue 1105: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1105\n.. _issue 1163: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1163\n.. _issue 1195: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1195\n.. _issue 1205: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1205\n.. _pull 1220: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1220\n\n\n.. _changes_60b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0b1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.\n\n- Added support for the Python 3.10 ``match/case`` syntax.\n\n- Data collection is now thread-safe.  There may have been rare instances of\n  exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.\n\n- Plugins (like the `Django coverage plugin`_) were generating &quot;Already\n  imported a file that will be measured&quot; warnings about Django itself.  These\n  have been fixed, closing `issue 1150`_.\n\n- Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.\n\n- Using ``--fail-under=100`` with coverage near 100% could result in the\n  self-contradictory message :code:`total of 100 is less than fail-under=100`.\n  This bug (`issue 1168`_) is now fixed.\n\n- The ``COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE`` environment variable now accepts ``stdout`` and\n  ``stderr`` to write to those destinations.\n\n- TOML parsing now uses the `tomli`_ library.\n\n- Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML report:\n\n  - Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for high-security\n    environments (`issue 1189`_).  When generating the HTML report, we save the\n    hash of the data, to avoid regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to\n    use MD5 to generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256.  This was never a\n    security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5 algorithm and\n    raise a false alarm.\n\n  - Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading underscores\n    (`issue 1167`_), to avoid rare file name collisions (`issue 584`_), and to\n    avoid file names becoming too long (`issue 580`_).\n\n.. _Django coverage plugin: https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/\n.. _issue 580: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/580\n.. _issue 584: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/584\n.. _issue 1150: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1150\n.. _issue 1167: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1167\n.. _issue 1168: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1168\n.. _issue 1189: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1189\n.. _tomli: https://pypi.org/project/tomli/\n\n\n.. _changes_56b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.6b1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nNote: 5.6 final was never released. These changes are part of 6.0.\n\n- Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting.  This solves a\n  few problems:\n\n  - Coverage will no longer report about other people&#x27;s code (`issue 876`_).\n    This is true even when using ``--source=.`` with a venv in the current\n    directory.\n\n  - Coverage will no longer generate &quot;Already imported a file that will be\n    measured&quot; warnings about coverage itself (`issue 905`_).\n\n- The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of\n  code.  They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior.\n  Now the highlighting is working again.\n\n- The JSON report now includes ``percent_covered_display``, a string with the\n  total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other\n  reports&#x27; totals.\n\n.. _issue 876: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876\n.. _issue 905: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905\n\n\n.. _changes_55:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.5\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- ``coverage combine`` has a new option, ``--keep`` to keep the original data\n  files after combining them.  The default is still to delete the files after\n  they have been combined.  This was requested in `issue 1108`_ and implemented\n  in `pull request 1110`_.  Thanks, \u00c9ric Larivi\u00e8re.\n\n- When reporting missing branches in ``coverage report``, branches aren&#x27;t\n  reported that jump to missing lines.  This adds to the long-standing behavior\n  of not reporting branches from missing lines.  Now branches are only reported\n  if both the source and destination lines are executed.  Closes both `issue\n  1065`_ and `issue 955`_.\n\n- Minor improvements to the HTML report:\n\n  - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage\n    so you don&#x27;t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing `issue 1123`_.\n\n  - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work\n    well, fixing `issue 1124`_.\n\n- Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users\n  will be more likely to understand what&#x27;s happening, closing `issue 803`_.\n\n.. _issue 803: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803\n.. _issue 955: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955\n.. _issue 1065: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065\n.. _issue 1108: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108\n.. _pull request 1110: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110\n.. _issue 1123: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123\n.. _issue 1124: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124\n\n\n.. _changes_54:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.4\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The text report produced by ``coverage report`` now always outputs a TOTAL\n  line, even if only one Python file is reported.  This makes regex parsing\n  of the output easier.  Thanks, Judson Neer.  This had been requested a number\n  of times (`issue 1086`_, `issue 922`_, `issue 732`_).\n\n- The ``skip_covered`` and ``skip_empty`` settings in the configuration file\n  can now be specified in the ``[html]`` section, so that text reports and HTML\n  reports can use separate settings.  The HTML report will still use the\n  ``[report]`` settings if there isn&#x27;t a value in the ``[html]`` section.\n  Closes `issue 1090`_.\n\n- Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing `issue\n  577`_.  Thanks, `Valentin Lab &lt;pr1080_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in\n  `issue 1084`_.\n\n- Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including `PEP 626: Precise\n  line numbers for debugging and other tools &lt;pep626_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 577: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577\n.. _issue 732: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732\n.. _issue 922: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922\n.. _issue 1084: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084\n.. _issue 1086: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086\n.. _issue 1090: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090\n.. _pr1080: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080\n.. _pep626: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/\n\n\n.. _changes_531:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- When using ``--source`` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous\n  versions.  This performance regression is now fixed, closing `issue 1037`_.\n\n- Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in `issue 1010`_. An\n  immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying\n  solution.\n\n- The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way,\n  fixing `issue 986`_.  Thanks, Sebasti\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (`pull request 1066`_).\n\n- The HTML report pages now have a :ref:`Sleepy Snake &lt;sleepy&gt;` favicon.\n\n- Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).\n\n- Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.\n\n.. _issue 986: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986\n.. _issue 1037: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037\n.. _issue 1010: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\n.. _pull request 1066: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066\n\n\n.. _changes_53:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.3\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The ``source`` setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a\n  module, depending on which existed.  If both interpretations were valid, it\n  was assumed to be a file path.  The new ``source_pkgs`` setting can be used\n  to name a package to disambiguate this case.  Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes\n  `issue 268`_.\n\n- If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record\n  its information, causing an exception, as reported in `issue 1011`_.  This is\n  now fixed.\n\n.. _issue 268: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268\n.. _issue 1011: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011\n\n\n.. scriv-end-here\n\nOlder

They are now changed to mention &quot;branch coverage data&quot; and\n  &quot;statement coverage data.&quot;\n\n- Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard match/case cases using\n  names or guard clauses.\n\n- Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python.  I&#x27;m not\n  claiming full support yet.  Closes `issue 1799`_.\n\n.. _issue 1799: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1799\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Performance improvements for combining data files, especially when measuring\n  line coverage. A few different quadratic behaviors were eliminated. In one\n  extreme case of combining 700+ data files, the time dropped from more than\n  three hours to seven minutes.  Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the fix.\n\n- Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a side benefit of\n  reducing memory use, closing `issue 1791`_.  Thanks to Daniel Diniz for\n  helping to diagnose the problem.\n\n.. _issue 1791: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1791\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as\n  reported in `issue 1779`_.  This is now fixed.\n\n- Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an\n  executable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not\n  executable if it was the first line.  Now module docstrings are never counted\n  as executable statements.  This can change coverage.py&#x27;s count of the number\n  of statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage\n  reported.\n\n- In the HTML report, the filter term and &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox settings are\n  remembered between viewings, thanks to `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1776_&gt;`_.\n\n- Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.\n\n- Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are\n  handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to `Liam DeVoe\n  &lt;pull 1788_&gt;`_. Closes `issue 1787`_.\n\n.. _pull 1776: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1776\n.. _issue 1779: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1779\n.. _issue 1787: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1787\n.. _pull 1788: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1788\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement\n  now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is\n  on the first line. This closes `issue 754`_. The fix was contributed by\n  `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1773_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: very complex source files like `this one &lt;resolvent_lookup_&gt;`_ could\n  cause a maximum recursion error when creating an HTML report.  This is now\n  fixed, closing `issue 1774`_.\n\n- HTML report improvements:\n\n  - Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have\n    hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of\n    stale cached copies.\n\n  - Missing branch coverage explanations that said &quot;the condition was never\n    false&quot; now read &quot;the condition was always true&quot; because it&#x27;s easier to\n    understand.\n\n  - Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index pages,\n    fixing `issue 1766`_.  Thanks, `Daniel Diniz &lt;pull 1768_&gt;`_.\n\n\n.. _resolvent_lookup: https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/130950f3e6b3f97fcc17f4599ac08f70fdd2e9d4/sympy/polys/numberfields/resolvent_lookup.py\n.. _issue 754: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/754\n.. _issue 1766: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1766\n.. _pull 1768: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1768\n.. _pull 1773: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1773\n.. _issue 1774: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1774\n\n\n.. _changes_7-5-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.5.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report.\n  There are now three index pages which link to each other: files, functions,\n  and classes.  Other reports don&#x27;t yet have this information, but it will be\n  added in the future where it makes sense.  Feedback gladly accepted!\n  Finishes `issue 780`_.\n\n- Other HTML report improvements:\n\n  - There is now a &quot;hide covered&quot; checkbox to filter out 100% files, finishing\n    `issue 1384`_.\n\n  - The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer\n    indications of the sorting.\n\n  - The &quot;previous file&quot; shortcut key didn&#x27;t work on the index page, but now it\n    does, fixing `issue 1765`_.\n\n- The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows\n  absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren&#x27;t taking effect,\n  and is renamed from &quot;attempted_config_files&quot; to the more logical\n  &quot;config_files_attempted.&quot;\n\n- Python 3.13.0a6 is supported.\n\n.. _issue 780: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/780\n.. _issue 1384: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1384\n.. _issue 1765: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1765\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: in some cases, even with ``[run] relative_files=True``, a data file\n  could be created with absolute path names.  When combined with other relative\n  data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made\n  relative or not. If they weren&#x27;t, then a file would be listed twice in\n  reports, as detailed in `issue 1752`_.  This is now fixed: absolute file\n  names are always made relative when combining.  Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos\n  Santos for support.\n\n- Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the\n  branch was missed.  It said the pattern never matched, when actually the\n  branch is missed if the last case always matched.\n\n- Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.\n\n- Fix: the ``report:format`` setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a\n  string.  Thanks, `Tanaydin Sirin &lt;pull 1754_&gt;`_.  It is also now documented\n  on the :ref:`configuration page &lt;config_report_format&gt;`.\n\n.. _issue 1752: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752\n.. _pull 1754: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: &quot;Set changed\n  size during iteration.&quot; This is now fixed, closing `issue 1733`_.\n\n.. _issue 1733: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: setting ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` no longer errors on 3.11 and lower,\n  thanks `Hugo van Kemenade &lt;pull 1747_&gt;`_.  It now issues a warning that\n  sys.monitoring is not available and falls back to the default core instead.\n\n.. _pull 1747: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1747\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Python 3.13.0a3 is supported.\n\n- Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number, closing\n  `issue 1732`_.\n\n.. _issue 1732: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1732\n\n\n.. _changes_7-4-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.4.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new\n  :mod:`sys.monitoring &lt;python:sys.monitoring&gt;` module by defining a\n  ``COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon`` environment variable.  This should be faster for\n  line coverage, but not for branch coverage, and plugins and dynamic contexts\n  are not yet supported with it.  I am very interested to hear how it works (or\n  doesn&#x27;t!) for you.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other\n  forms of nested clauses being excluded properly.  This is now fixed, closing\n  `issue 1713`_.\n\n- Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won&#x27;t select the line\n  numbers also. Thanks, `Robert Harris &lt;pull 1717_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1713: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1713\n.. _pull 1717: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1717\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded by\n  matching any of the lines, closing `issue 684`_.  Thanks, `Jan Rusak,\n  Maciej Kowalczyk and Joanna Ejzel &lt;pull 1705_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric components\n  that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like ``file1.py`` and\n  ``file001.py``.  Fixes `issue 1709`_.\n\n- The ``coverage annotate`` command used to announce that it would be removed\n  in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it, so\n  it will stay.  Don&#x27;t expect it to keep up with other new features though.\n\n- Added new :ref:`debug options &lt;cmd_run_debug&gt;`:\n\n  - ``pytest`` writes the pytest test name into the debug output.\n\n  - ``dataop2`` writes the full data being added to CoverageData objects.\n\n.. _issue 684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/684\n.. _pull 1705: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1705\n.. _issue 1709: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1709\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- The ``coverage lcov`` command ignored the ``[report] exclude_lines`` and\n  ``[report] exclude_also`` settings (`issue 1684`_).  This is now fixed,\n  thanks `Jacqueline Lee &lt;pull 1685_&gt;`_.\n\n- Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database\n  files.  These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining\n  data files.  Now they are always ignored, fixing `issue 1605`_. Thanks to\n  Brad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.\n\n- On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be\n  a little faster.\n\n- The new 3.12 soft keyword ``type`` is properly bolded in HTML reports.\n\n- Removed the &quot;fullcoverage&quot; feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of\n  early-imported standard library modules.  CPython `stopped using it\n  &lt;88054_&gt;`_ in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.\n\n.. _issue 1605: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605\n.. _issue 1684: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684\n.. _pull 1685: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685\n.. _88054: https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054\n\n\n.. _changes_7-3-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in the docs.  A\n  leading or trailing star matches any number of path components, like a double\n  star would.  This is different than the behavior of a star in the middle of a\n  pattern.  This discrepancy was `identified by Sviatoslav Sydorenko\n  &lt;starbad_&gt;`_, who `provided patient detailed diagnosis &lt;pull 1650_&gt;`_ and\n  graciously agreed to a pragmatic resolution.\n\n- The API docs were missing from the last version. They are now `restored\n  &lt;apidocs_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _apidocs: https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_coverage.html\n.. _starbad: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407#issuecomment-1631085209\n.. _pull 1650: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1650\n\n.. _changes_7-3-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.3.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added a :meth:`.Coverage.collect` context manager to start and stop coverage\n  data collection.\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.7.\n\n- Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to asynchronous mode.\n  Coverage.py would fail with the error ``Safety level may not be changed\n  inside a transaction.`` This is now avoided, closing `issue 1646`_.  Thanks\n  to Michael Bell for the detailed bug report.\n\n- Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate examples for the\n  different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, and tox.ini.\n\n- Fix: added ``nosemgrep`` comments to our JavaScript code so that\n  semgrep-based SAST security checks won&#x27;t raise false alarms about security\n  problems that aren&#x27;t problems.\n\n- Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to `Ken Schackart &lt;pull 1641_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _pull 1641: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1641\n.. _issue 1646: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1646\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-7:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.7\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: reverted a `change from 6.4.3 &lt;pull 1347b_&gt;`_ that helped Cython, but\n  also increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as\n  described in the now-fixed `issue 1586`_. The problem is now avoided due to a\n  recent change (`issue 1538 &lt;issue 1538b_&gt;`_).

Jinja2 does this\n  when rendering templates.  Fixes `issue 1553`_.\n\n- Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions.  Previously they were compiled\n  as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn you if they weren&#x27;t\n  completely executed.  This no longer happens under Python 3.12.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage debug sys`` command includes some environment variables\n  in its output.  This could have included sensitive data.  Those values are\n  now hidden with asterisks, closing `issue 1628`_.\n\n.. _issue 1553: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1553\n.. _issue 1628: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1628\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-5:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.5\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: ``html_report()`` could fail with an AttributeError on ``isatty`` if run\n  in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced.  This is now\n  fixed.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nPyCon 2023 sprint fixes!\n\n- Fix: with ``relative_files = true``, specifying a specific file to include or\n  omit wouldn&#x27;t work correctly (`issue 1604`_).  This is now fixed, with\n  testing help by `Marc Gibbons &lt;pull 1608_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect ``&lt;source&gt;`` element when using\n  relative files and the source option ended with a slash (`issue 1541`_).\n  This is now fixed, thanks to `Kevin Brown-Silva &lt;pull 1608_&gt;`_.\n\n- When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it&#x27;s now a\n  terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to open the HTML\n  file in your browser.  Finishes `issue 1523`_ thanks to `Ricardo Newbery\n  &lt;pull 1613_&gt;`_.\n\n- Docs: a new :ref:`Migrating page &lt;migrating&gt;` with details about how to\n  migrate between major versions of coverage.py.  It currently covers the\n  wildcard changes in 7.x.

This was\n  fixed thanks to `Lewis Gaul &lt;pull 1600_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1599`_.\n\n- Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much more compact.\n  File sizes are typically as small as one-third the previous size, but can be\n  dramatically smaller. This closes `issue 1584`_ thanks to `Oleh Krehel\n  &lt;pull 1587_&gt;`_.\n\n- Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing `issue 1592`_.\n\n.. _issue 1584: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1584\n.. _pull 1587: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1587\n.. _issue 1592: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1592\n.. _issue 1599: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1599\n.. _pull 1600: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1600\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: if a virtualenv was created inside a source directory, and a sourced\n  package was installed inside the virtualenv, then all of the third-party\n  packages inside the virtualenv would be measured.  This was incorrect, but\n  has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be measured, thanks to\n  `Manuel Jacob &lt;pull 1560_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` command could create a .lcov file with incorrect\n  LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Ian Moore &lt;pull 1583_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage xml`` command on Windows could create a .xml file with\n  duplicate ``&lt;package&gt;`` elements. This is now fixed, thanks to `Benjamin\n  Parzella &lt;pull 1574_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1573`_.\n\n.. _pull 1560: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1560\n.. _issue 1573: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1573\n.. _pull 1574: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1574\n.. _pull 1583: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1583\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages, but no longer\n  does, closing `issue 1566`_.\n\n- Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly indicated so that\n  mypy will find them, fixing `issue 1564`_.\n\n.. _issue 1564: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1564\n.. _issue 1566: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1566\n\n\n.. _changes_7-2-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.2.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added a new setting ``[report] exclude_also`` to let you add more exclusions\n  without overwriting the defaults.  Thanks, `Alpha Chen &lt;pull 1557_&gt;`_,\n  closing `issue 1391`_.\n\n- Added a :meth:`.CoverageData.purge_files` method to remove recorded data for\n  a particular file.  Contributed by `Stephan Deibel &lt;pull 1547_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer congratulate\n  themselves with messages like &quot;Wrote XML report to file.xml&quot; before spewing a\n  traceback about their failure.\n\n- Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now accept pathlib.Path\n  objects.  This includes the ``data_file`` and ``config_file`` arguments to\n  the Coverage constructor and the ``basename`` argument to CoverageData.\n  Closes `issue 1552`_.\n\n- Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur on stop() when\n  the originating thread exits before completion.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Russell Keith-Magee &lt;pull 1543_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1542`_.\n\n- Added a ``py.typed`` file to announce our type-hintedness.  Thanks,\n  `KotlinIsland &lt;pull 1550_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1391: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1391\n.. _issue 1542: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1542\n.. _pull 1543: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1543\n.. _pull 1547: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1547\n.. _pull 1550: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1550\n.. _issue 1552: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1552\n.. _pull 1557: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1557\n\n\n.. _changes_7-1-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.1.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Added: the debug output file can now be specified with ``[run] debug_file``\n  in the configuration file.  Closes `issue 1319`_.\n\n- Performance: fixed a slowdown with dynamic contexts that&#x27;s been around since\n  6.4.3.  The fix closes `issue 1538`_.  Thankfully this doesn&#x27;t break the\n  `Cython change`_ that fixed `issue 972`_.  Thanks to Mathieu Kniewallner for\n  the deep investigative work and comprehensive issue report.\n\n- Typing: all product and test code has type annotations.\n\n.. _Cython change: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347\n.. _issue 972: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972\n.. _issue 1319: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1319\n.. _issue 1538: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-5:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.5\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: On Python 3.7, a file with type annotations but no ``from __future__\n  import annotations`` would be missing statements in the coverage report. This\n  is now fixed, closing `issue 1524`_.\n\n.. _issue 1524: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1524\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-4:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.4\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Performance: an internal cache of file names was accidentally disabled,\n  resulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance.  This is now fixed,\n  closing `issue 1527`_.   Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test\n  case.\n\n.. _issue 1527: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-3:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining\n  step could fail with ``assert row is not None`` using 7.0.2.  This was due to\n  a race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In\n  7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code.\n  Now it will produce a message &quot;Couldn&#x27;t combine data file&quot; and ignore the\n  data file as it used to do before 7.0.2.  Closes `issue 1522`_.\n\n.. _issue 1522: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: when using the ``[run] relative_files = True`` setting, a relative\n  ``[paths]`` pattern was still being made absolute.  This is now fixed,\n  closing `issue 1519`_.\n\n- Fix: if Python doesn&#x27;t provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can\n  only be read if coverage.py is installed with the ``[toml]`` extra.\n  Coverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees\n  your settings are in a .toml file. But it didn&#x27;t understand that\n  ``[tools.coverage]`` was a valid section header, so the error wasn&#x27;t reported\n  if you used that header, and settings were silently ignored.  This is now\n  fixed, closing `issue 1516`_.\n\n- Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing `issue 1515`_.\n\n- Fix: the ``coverage lcov`` report did not properly implement the\n  ``--fail-under=MIN`` option.  This has been fixed.\n\n- Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings.\n  This should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some\n  places, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.\n\n- Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and\n  IronPython.\n\n.. _issue 1515: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515\n.. _issue 1516: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516\n.. _issue 1519: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists, we weren&#x27;t\n  considering files in .whl files.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1511`_.\n\n- File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and curly braces in\n  directory and file names.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1513`_.\n\n- Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could prevent\n  reporting.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1512`_.\n\n- The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing `issue 1510`_.\n\n.. _issue 1510: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1510\n.. _issue 1511: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1511\n.. _issue 1512: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1512\n.. _issue 1513: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1513\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-0:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.0\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nNothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.\n\n\n.. _changes_7-0-0b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 7.0.0b1\n   ```\n   ----------------------------\n\nA number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern\nmatching and path remapping with the ``[paths]`` setting (see\n:ref:`config_paths`).  These changes might affect you, and require you to\nupdate your settings.\n\n(This release includes the changes from `6.6.0b1`__, since 6.6.0 was never\nreleased.)\n\n__ https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-6-6-0b1\n\n- Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your\n  configuration:\n\n  - Previously, ``*`` would incorrectly match directory separators, making\n    precise matching difficult.  This is now fixed, closing `issue 1407`_.\n\n  - Now ``**`` matches any number of nested directories, including none.\n\n- Improvements to combining data files when using the\n  :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting, which might require updating your\n  configuration:\n\n  - During ``coverage combine``, relative file paths are implicitly combined\n    without needing a ``[paths]`` configuration setting.  This also fixed\n    `issue 991`_.\n\n  - A ``[paths]`` setting like ``*/foo`` will now match ``foo/bar.py`` so that\n    relative file paths can be combined more easily.\n\n  - The :ref:`config_run_relative_files` setting is properly interpreted in\n    more places, fixing `issue 1280`_.\n\n- When remapping file paths with ``[paths]``, a path will be remapped only if\n  the resulting path exists.  The documentation has long said the prefix had to\n  exist, but it was never enforced.  This fixes `issue 608`_, improves `issue\n  649`_, and closes `issue 757`_.\n\n- Reporting operations now implicitly use the ``[paths]`` setting to remap file\n  paths within a single data file.  Combining multiple files still requires the\n  ``coverage combine`` step, but this simplifies some single-file situations.\n  Closes `issue 1212`_ and `issue 713`_.\n\n- The ``coverage report`` command now has a ``--format=`` option.  The original\n  style is now ``--format=text``, and is the default.\n\n  - Using ``--format=markdown`` will write the table in Markdown format, thanks\n    to `Steve Oswald &lt;pull 1479_&gt;`_, closing `issue 1418`_.\n\n  - Using ``--format=total`` will write a single total number to the\n    output.  This can be useful for making badges or writing status updates.\n\n- Combining data files with ``coverage combine`` now hashes the data files to\n  skip files that add no new information.  This can reduce the time needed.\n  Many details affect the speed-up, but for coverage.py&#x27;s own test suite,\n  combining is about 40% faster. Closes `issue 1483`_.\n\n- When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py uses the\n  presence of ``__init__.py`` files to determine which directories have source\n  that could have been imported.  However, `implicit namespace packages`_ don&#x27;t\n  require ``__init__.py``.  A new setting ``[report]\n  include_namespace_packages`` tells coverage.py to consider these directories\n  during reporting.  Thanks to `Felix Horvat &lt;pull 1387_&gt;`_ for the\n  contribution.  Closes `issue 1383`_ and `issue 1024`_.\n\n- Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files.  It was overly\n  broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in `issue\n  1481`_ and `issue 1345`_.  This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require\n  changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment\n  substitution.\n\n- An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail with\n  ``--fail-under``.  This has been fixed, closing `issue 1470`_.\n\n- The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines if there are\n  no files listed in the table.  One is plenty.\n\n- Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard alternatives in\n  match/case statements, closing `issue 1421`_.\n\n- Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on\n  implementations other than CPython or PyPy (`issue 1474`_).\n\n- The deprecated ``[run] note`` setting has been completely removed.\n\n.. _implicit namespace packages: https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/\n.. _issue 608: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/608\n.. _issue 649: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/649\n.. _issue 713: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/713\n.. _issue 757: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/757\n.. _issue 991: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991\n.. _issue 1024: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1024\n.. _issue 1212: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1212\n.. _issue 1280: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280\n.. _issue 1345: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345\n.. _issue 1383: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1383\n.. _issue 1407: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407\n.. _issue 1418: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1418\n.. _issue 1421: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1421\n.. _issue 1470: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1470\n.. _issue 1474: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474\n.. _issue 1481: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481\n.. _issue 1483: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1483\n.. _pull 1387: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1387\n.. _pull 1479: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1479\n\n\n.. _changes_6-6-0b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.6.0b1\n   ```\n   ----------------------------\n\n(Note: 6.6.0 final was never released.

Thanks,\n  `Matus Valo &lt;pull 1347_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 972: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972\n.. _issue 1428: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1428\n.. _pull 1347: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347\n.. _pull 1403: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1403\n.. _pull 1405: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1405\n.. _pull 1413: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1413\n.. _pull 1430: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1430\n\n\n.. _changes_6-4-2:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.4.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Updated for a small change in Python 3.11.0 beta 4: modules now start with a\n  line with line number 0, which is ignored.  This line cannot be executed, so\n  coverage totals were thrown off.  This line is now ignored by coverage.py,\n  but this also means that truly empty modules (like ``__init__.py``) have no\n  lines in them, rather than one phantom line.  Fixes `issue 1419`_.\n\n- Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to\n  avoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules.  Thanks,\n  `Yilei Yang &lt;pull 1399_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 1419: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1419\n.. _pull 1399: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1399\n\n\n.. _changes_6-4-1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.4.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that need the\n  pure Python trace function.  Thanks, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick (`pull\n  1381`_ and `pull 1388`_).  Slightly improved performance when using the C\n  trace function, as most environments do.  Closes `issue 1339`_.\n\n- The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have been made\n  more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to work. Closes `issue\n  1390`_.\n\n.. _issue 1339: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1339\n.. _pull 1381: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1381\n.. _pull 1388: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1388\n.. _issue 1390: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1390\n\n\n.. _changes_64:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.4\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- A new setting, :ref:`config_run_sigterm`, controls whether a SIGTERM signal\n  handler is used.  In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed, to capture\n  data at unusual process ends.  Unfortunately, this introduced other problems\n  (see `issue 1310`_).  Now the signal handler is only used if you opt-in by\n  setting ``[run] sigterm = true``.\n\n- Small changes to the HTML report:\n\n  - Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard shortcuts: ``[``\n    and ``]`` for next file and previous file; ``u`` for up to the index; and\n    ``?`` to open/close the help panel.  Thanks, `J. M. F. Tsang\n    &lt;pull 1364_&gt;`_.\n\n  - The time stamp and version are displayed at the top of the report.  Thanks,\n    `Ammar Askar &lt;pull 1354_&gt;`_. Closes `issue 1351`_.\n\n- A new debug option ``debug=sqldata`` adds more detail to ``debug=sql``,\n  logging all the data being written to the database.\n\n- Previously, running ``coverage report`` (or any of the reporting commands) in\n  an empty directory would create a .coverage data file.  Now they do not,\n  fixing `issue 1328`_.\n\n- On Python 3.11, the ``[toml]`` extra no longer installs tomli, instead using\n  tomllib from the standard library.  Thanks `Shantanu &lt;pull 1359_&gt;`_.\n\n- In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing `issue 1323`_.\n\n.. _issue 1310: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310\n.. _issue 1323: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1323\n.. _issue 1328: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1328\n.. _issue 1351: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1351\n.. _pull 1354: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1354\n.. _pull 1359: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1359\n.. _pull 1364: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1364\n\n\n.. _changes_633:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.3\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: Coverage.py now builds successfully on CPython 3.11 (3.11.0b1) again.\n  Closes `issue 1367`_.  Some results for generators may have changed.\n\n.. _issue 1367: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1367\n\n\n.. _changes_632:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: adapt to pypy3.9&#x27;s decorator tracing behavior.  It now traces function\n  decorators like CPython 3.8: both the -line and the def-line are traced.\n  Fixes `issue 1326`_.\n\n- Debug: added ``pybehave`` to the list of :ref:`coverage debug &lt;cmd_debug&gt;`\n  and :ref:`cmd_run_debug` options.\n\n- Fix: show an intelligible error message if ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``\n  is used without a configuration file.  Closes `issue 1320`_.\n\n.. _issue 1320: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1320\n.. _issue 1326: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1326\n\n\n.. _changes_631:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes.  Some of these\n  deadlocks (described in `issue 1310`_) are now fixed.\n\n- Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing an error:\n  &quot;ValueError: signal only works in main thread&quot;.  This is now fixed, closing\n  `issue 1312`_.\n\n- Fix: ``--precision`` on the command-line was being ignored while considering\n  ``--fail-under``.  This is now fixed, thanks to\n  `Marcelo Trylesinski &lt;pull 1317_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py uses CPython\n  internal fields which are moving during the alpha phase. Fixes `issue 1316`_.\n\n.. _issue 1310: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310\n.. _issue 1312: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1312\n.. _issue 1316: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1316\n.. _pull 1317: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1317\n\n\n.. _changes_63:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.3\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Feature: Added the ``lcov`` command to generate reports in LCOV format.\n  Thanks, `Bradley Burns &lt;pull 1289_&gt;`_. Closes issues `587 &lt;issue 587_&gt;`_\n  and `626 &lt;issue 626_&gt;`_.\n\n- Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the command line with\n  the ``--data-file`` option in any command that reads or writes data.  This is\n  in addition to the existing ``COVERAGE_FILE`` environment variable.  Closes\n  `issue 624`_. Thanks, `Nikita Bloshchanevich &lt;pull 1304_&gt;`_.\n\n- Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a SIGTERM signal\n  is received by the process.  This includes\n  :meth:`Process.terminate &lt;python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate&gt;`,\n  and other ways to terminate a process.  Currently this is only on Linux and\n  Mac; Windows is not supported.  Fixes `issue 1307`_.\n\n- Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on 2021-12-23.\n\n- Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing `issue 1294`_.\n\n- Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way, to avoid\n  problems when multiple processes are trying to write data at once. Fixes\n  issues `1303 &lt;issue 1303_&gt;`_ and `883 &lt;issue 883_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report output\n  directory if the directory is empty.  This should prevent certain unfortunate\n  accidents of writing the file where it is not wanted.\n\n- Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing `issue 1288`_.\n\n.. _issue 587: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/587\n.. _issue 624: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/624\n.. _issue 626: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/626\n.. _issue 883: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/883\n.. _issue 1288: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1288\n.. _issue 1294: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1294\n.. _issue 1303: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1303\n.. _issue 1307: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1307\n.. _pull 1289: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1289\n.. _pull 1304: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1304\n\n\n.. _changes_62:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.2\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Feature: Now the ``--concurrency`` setting can have a list of values, so that\n  threads and another lightweight threading package can be measured together,\n  such as ``--concurrency=gevent,thread``.  Closes `issue 1012`_ and `issue\n  1082`_.  This also means that ``thread`` must be explicitly specified in some\n  cases that used to be implicit such as ``--concurrency=multiprocessing``,\n  which must be changed to ``--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread``.\n\n- Fix: A module specified as the ``source`` setting is imported during startup,\n  before the user program imports it.  This could cause problems if the rest of\n  the program isn&#x27;t ready yet.  For example, `issue 1203`_ describes a Django\n  setting that is accessed before settings have been configured.  Now the early\n  import is wrapped in a try/except so errors then don&#x27;t stop execution.\n\n- Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion to end too\n  early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated function. This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file that already\n  exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for `issue 1244\n  &lt;issue 1244b_&gt;`_).\n\n- API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been specialized, to provide\n  finer-grained catching of exceptions by third-party code.\n\n- API: Using ``suffix=False`` when constructing a Coverage object with\n  multiprocessing wouldn&#x27;t suppress the data file suffix (`issue 989`_).  This\n  is now fixed.\n\n- Debug: The ``coverage debug data`` command will now sniff out combinable data\n  files, and report on all of them.\n\n- Debug: The ``coverage debug`` command used to accept a number of topics at a\n  time, and show all of them, though this was never documented.  This no longer\n  works, to allow for command-line options in the future.\n\n.. _issue 989: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/989\n.. _issue 1012: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1012\n.. _issue 1082: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1082\n.. _issue 1203: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1203\n.. _issue 1244b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244\n\n\n.. _changes_612:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2).  One still-open issue has to\n  do with `exits through with-statements &lt;issue 1270_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix: When remapping file paths through the ``[paths]`` setting while\n  combining, the ``[run] relative_files`` setting was ignored, resulting in\n  absolute paths for remapped file names (`issue 1147`_).  This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have incorrectly reported\n  a missing branch (`issue 1271`_). This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse source files for\n  reporting.  Problems that used to terminate coverage.py can now be handled\n  with ``[report] ignore_errors``.  This helps with plugins failing to read\n  files (`django_coverage_plugin issue 78`_).\n\n- Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball\n  (`issue 840 &lt;issue 840b_&gt;`_).\n\n- Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an internal class.\n  This unsupported class is being used by coveralls (`issue 1273`_). Although\n  I&#x27;d rather not &quot;fix&quot; unsupported interfaces, it&#x27;s actually nicer with a\n  default value.\n\n.. _django_coverage_plugin issue 78: https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/78\n.. _issue 840b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840\n.. _issue 1147: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1147\n.. _issue 1270: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1270\n.. _issue 1271: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1271\n.. _issue 1273: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1273\n\n\n.. _changes_611:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn&#x27;t work unless you had branch\n  coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky header works for everyone.\n  (Do people still use coverage without branch measurement!? j/k)\n\n- Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the &quot;already imported\n  a file that will be measured&quot; warning would be issued (`issue 888`_).  This\n  is now fixed.\n\n.. _issue 888: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/888\n\n\n.. _changes_61:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.1\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- Deprecated: The ``annotate`` command and the ``Coverage.annotate`` function\n  will be removed in a future version, unless people let me know that they are\n  using it.  Instead, the ``html`` command gives better-looking (and more\n  accurate) output, and the ``report -m`` command will tell you line numbers of\n  missing lines.  Please get in touch if you have a reason to use ``annotate``\n  over those better options: nednedbatchelder.com.\n\n- Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable, ``COVERAGE_RUN`` when\n  running your code with the ``coverage run`` command.  The value is not\n  important, and may change in the future.  Closes `issue 553`_.\n\n- Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have a sticky\n  header so the file name and controls are always visible.\n\n- Feature: The ``xml`` and ``json`` commands now describe what they wrote\n  where.\n\n- Feature: The ``html``, ``combine``, ``xml``, and ``json`` commands all accept\n  a ``-q/--quiet`` option to suppress the messages they write to stdout about\n  what they are doing (`issue 1254`_).\n\n- Feature: The ``html`` command writes a ``.gitignore`` file into the HTML\n  output directory, to prevent the report from being committed to git.  If you\n  want to commit it, you will need to delete that file.  Closes `issue 1244`_.\n\n- Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.\n\n- Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement.  Code such as\n  `attrs`_ boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured though the\n  synthetic line numbers meant they were never reported.  Once Cython was\n  involved though, the generated .so files were parsed as Python, raising\n  syntax errors, as reported in `issue 1160`_.  This is now fixed.\n\n- Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are sorted\n  correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py.  This applies to file names,\n  module names, environment variables, and test contexts.\n\n- Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you might only\n  notice on code that is executed many times, such as long-running loops.\n\n- Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored (`issue 840`_ and `issue 1118`_).\n  Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the conversion to vanilla\n  JavaScript in `pull request 1248`_.\n\n.. _issue 553: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/553\n.. _issue 840: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840\n.. _issue 1118: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1118\n.. _issue 1160: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1160\n.. _issue 1244: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244\n.. _pull request 1248: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1248\n.. _issue 1254: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1254\n.. _attrs: https://www.attrs.org/\n\n\n.. _changes_602:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0.2\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Namespace packages being measured weren&#x27;t properly handled by the new code\n  that ignores third-party packages. If the namespace package was installed, it\n  was ignored as a third-party package.  That problem (`issue 1231`_) is now\n  fixed.\n\n- Packages named as &quot;source packages&quot; (with ``source``, or ``source_pkgs``, or\n  pytest-cov&#x27;s ``--cov``) might have been only partially measured.  Their\n  top-level statements could be marked as un-executed, because they were\n  imported by coverage.py before measurement began (`issue 1232`_).  This is\n  now fixed, but the package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then\n  again by your test suite.  This could cause problems if importing the package\n  has side effects.\n\n- The :meth:`.CoverageData.contexts_by_lineno` method was documented to return\n  a dict, but was returning a defaultdict.  Now it returns a plain dict.  It\n  also no longer returns negative numbered keys.\n\n.. _issue 1231: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1231\n.. _issue 1232: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1232\n\n\n.. _changes_601:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to\n  coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the public supported\n  API, CoverageException is. But a number of other third-party packages were\n  importing the exceptions from coverage.misc, so they are now available from\n  there again (`issue 1226`_).\n\n- Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that tomli can use\n  coverage.py for their own test suite (`issue 1228`_).\n\n- Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation, where a\n  function can have an argument called &quot;self&quot;, but no local named &quot;self&quot;\n  (`pull request 1210`_).  Thanks, Ben Carlsson.\n\n.. _pull request 1210: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1210\n.. _issue 1226: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1226\n.. _issue 1228: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1228\n\n\n.. _changes_60:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The ``coverage html`` command now prints a message indicating where the HTML\n  report was written.  Fixes `issue 1195`_.\n\n- The ``coverage combine`` command now prints messages indicating each data\n  file being combined.  Fixes `issue 1105`_.\n\n- The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due to\n  ``skip_covered`` or ``skip_empty`` settings.  Fixes `issue 1163`_.\n\n- Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer errors. They are\n  now warnings, to ease the use of coverage across versions.  Fixes `issue\n  1035`_.\n\n- Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python 3.10. A missing\n  exception is no longer considered a missing branch from the with statement.\n  Fixes `issue 1205`_.\n\n- Fix another rarer instance of &quot;Error binding parameter 0 - probably\n  unsupported type.&quot; (`issue 1010 &lt;issue 1010b_&gt;`_).\n\n- Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer against\n  conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously (`pull 1220`_).\n  Thanks, Cl\u00e9ment Pit-Claudel.\n\n.. _issue 1010b: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\n.. _issue 1035: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1035\n.. _issue 1105: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1105\n.. _issue 1163: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1163\n.. _issue 1195: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1195\n.. _issue 1205: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1205\n.. _pull 1220: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1220\n\n\n.. _changes_60b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 6.0b1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.\n\n- Added support for the Python 3.10 ``match/case`` syntax.\n\n- Data collection is now thread-safe.  There may have been rare instances of\n  exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.\n\n- Plugins (like the `Django coverage plugin`_) were generating &quot;Already\n  imported a file that will be measured&quot; warnings about Django itself.  These\n  have been fixed, closing `issue 1150`_.\n\n- Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.\n\n- Using ``--fail-under=100`` with coverage near 100% could result in the\n  self-contradictory message :code:`total of 100 is less than fail-under=100`.\n  This bug (`issue 1168`_) is now fixed.\n\n- The ``COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE`` environment variable now accepts ``stdout`` and\n  ``stderr`` to write to those destinations.\n\n- TOML parsing now uses the `tomli`_ library.\n\n- Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML report:\n\n  - Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for high-security\n    environments (`issue 1189`_).  When generating the HTML report, we save the\n    hash of the data, to avoid regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to\n    use MD5 to generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256.  This was never a\n    security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5 algorithm and\n    raise a false alarm.\n\n  - Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading underscores\n    (`issue 1167`_), to avoid rare file name collisions (`issue 584`_), and to\n    avoid file names becoming too long (`issue 580`_).\n\n.. _Django coverage plugin: https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/\n.. _issue 580: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/580\n.. _issue 584: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/584\n.. _issue 1150: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1150\n.. _issue 1167: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1167\n.. _issue 1168: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1168\n.. _issue 1189: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1189\n.. _tomli: https://pypi.org/project/tomli/\n\n\n.. _changes_56b1:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.6b1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\nNote: 5.6 final was never released. These changes are part of 6.0.\n\n- Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting.  This solves a\n  few problems:\n\n  - Coverage will no longer report about other people&#x27;s code (`issue 876`_).\n    This is true even when using ``--source=.`` with a venv in the current\n    directory.\n\n  - Coverage will no longer generate &quot;Already imported a file that will be\n    measured&quot; warnings about coverage itself (`issue 905`_).\n\n- The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of\n  code.  They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior.\n  Now the highlighting is working again.\n\n- The JSON report now includes ``percent_covered_display``, a string with the\n  total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other\n  reports&#x27; totals.\n\n.. _issue 876: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876\n.. _issue 905: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905\n\n\n.. _changes_55:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.5\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- ``coverage combine`` has a new option, ``--keep`` to keep the original data\n  files after combining them.  The default is still to delete the files after\n  they have been combined.  This was requested in `issue 1108`_ and implemented\n  in `pull request 1110`_.  Thanks, \u00c9ric Larivi\u00e8re.\n\n- When reporting missing branches in ``coverage report``, branches aren&#x27;t\n  reported that jump to missing lines.  This adds to the long-standing behavior\n  of not reporting branches from missing lines.  Now branches are only reported\n  if both the source and destination lines are executed.  Closes both `issue\n  1065`_ and `issue 955`_.\n\n- Minor improvements to the HTML report:\n\n  - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage\n    so you don&#x27;t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing `issue 1123`_.\n\n  - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work\n    well, fixing `issue 1124`_.\n\n- Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users\n  will be more likely to understand what&#x27;s happening, closing `issue 803`_.\n\n.. _issue 803: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803\n.. _issue 955: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955\n.. _issue 1065: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065\n.. _issue 1108: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108\n.. _pull request 1110: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110\n.. _issue 1123: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123\n.. _issue 1124: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124\n\n\n.. _changes_54:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.4\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The text report produced by ``coverage report`` now always outputs a TOTAL\n  line, even if only one Python file is reported.  This makes regex parsing\n  of the output easier.  Thanks, Judson Neer.  This had been requested a number\n  of times (`issue 1086`_, `issue 922`_, `issue 732`_).\n\n- The ``skip_covered`` and ``skip_empty`` settings in the configuration file\n  can now be specified in the ``[html]`` section, so that text reports and HTML\n  reports can use separate settings.  The HTML report will still use the\n  ``[report]`` settings if there isn&#x27;t a value in the ``[html]`` section.\n  Closes `issue 1090`_.\n\n- Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing `issue\n  577`_.  Thanks, `Valentin Lab &lt;pr1080_&gt;`_.\n\n- Fix an obscure warning from deep in the _decimal module, as reported in\n  `issue 1084`_.\n\n- Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including `PEP 626: Precise\n  line numbers for debugging and other tools &lt;pep626_&gt;`_.\n\n.. _issue 577: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577\n.. _issue 732: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732\n.. _issue 922: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922\n.. _issue 1084: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084\n.. _issue 1086: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086\n.. _issue 1090: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090\n.. _pr1080: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080\n.. _pep626: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/\n\n\n.. _changes_531:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.3.1\n   ```\n   --------------------------\n\n- When using ``--source`` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous\n  versions.  This performance regression is now fixed, closing `issue 1037`_.\n\n- Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in `issue 1010`_. An\n  immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying\n  solution.\n\n- The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way,\n  fixing `issue 986`_.  Thanks, Sebasti\u00e1n Ram\u00edrez (`pull request 1066`_).\n\n- The HTML report pages now have a :ref:`Sleepy Snake &lt;sleepy&gt;` favicon.\n\n- Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).\n\n- Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.\n\n.. _issue 986: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986\n.. _issue 1037: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037\n.. _issue 1010: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010\n.. _pull request 1066: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066\n\n\n.. _changes_53:\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 5.3\n   ```\n   ------------------------\n\n- The ``source`` setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a\n  module, depending on which existed.  If both interpretations were valid, it\n  was assumed to be a file path.  The new ``source_pkgs`` setting can be used\n  to name a package to disambiguate this case.  Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes\n  `issue 268`_.\n\n- If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record\n  its information, causing an exception, as reported in `issue 1011`_.  This is\n  now fixed.\n\n.. _issue 268: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268\n.. _issue 1011: https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011\n\n\n.. scriv-end-here\n\nOlder
