The aim is to gradually improve code quality by catching type-related errors early and enhancing the maintainability of the codebase.\r\n\r\n- Added mypy as a development dependency in requirements-dev.txt.\r\n\r\n- Created a mypy.ini configuration file with the following initial settings:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[mypy]\r\ndisallow_untyped_calls = false\r\ndisallow_untyped_defs = false\r\ndisallow_incomplete_defs = false\r\ncheck_untyped_defs = false\r\nignore_missing_imports = true\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Added .mypy_cache/ to .gitignore to exclude MyPy cache files from version control.\r\n\r\nAt this stage, MyPy integration is encouraged for development purposes, but it is not yet added to the GitHub CI tests due to the large number of initial errors that need to be addressed.\r\n\r\n# Type of change\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n<!--\r\nExample how to mark a checkbox :-\r\n- [x] My code follows the code style of this project.\r\n-->\r\n- [ ] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n- [x] New feature (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- [ ] Code style update (formatting, local variables)\r\n- [ ] Breaking change (fix or feature that would cause existing functionality to not work as expected)\r\n- [ ] This change requires a documentation update\r\n\r\n# How Has This Been Tested?\r\n\r\nMyPy has been run locally on the codebase to identify type-related issues. Developers are encouraged to run mypy . in their local development environments and address any type errors identified.\r\n\r\n# Describe if there is any unusual behaviour of your code(Write `NA` if
