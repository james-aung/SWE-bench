This will read the\n    Black version from `pyproject.toml`. ([#&#8203;4294](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4294))\n\n### [`v24.3.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#2430)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/24.2.0...24.3.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\nThis release is a milestone: it fixes Black's first CVE security vulnerability. If you\nrun Black on untrusted input, or if you habitually put thousands of leading tab\ncharacters in your docstrings, you are strongly encouraged to upgrade immediately to fix\n[CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).\n\nThis release also fixes a bug in Black's AST safety check that allowed Black to make\nincorrect changes to certain f-strings that are valid in Python 3.12 and higher.\n\n##### Stable style\n\n-   Don't move comments along with delimiters, which could cause crashes ([#&#8203;4248](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4248))\n-   Strengthen AST safety check to catch more unsafe changes to strings. Previous versions\n    of Black would incorrectly format the contents of certain unusual f-strings containing\n    nested strings with the same quote type. Now, Black will crash on such strings until\n    support for the new f-string syntax is implemented. ([#&#8203;4270](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4270))\n-   Fix a bug where line-ranges exceeding the last code line would not work as expected\n    ([#&#8203;4273](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4273))\n\n##### Performance\n\n-   Fix catastrophic performance on docstrings that contain large numbers of leading tab\n    characters. This fixes\n    [CVE-2024-21503](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-21503).\n    ([#&#8203;4278](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4278))\n\n##### Documentation\n\n-   Note what happens when `--check` is used with `--quiet` ([#&#8203;4236](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4236))\n\n### [`v24.2.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#2420)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/24.1.1...24.2.0)\n\n##### Stable style\n\n-   Fixed a bug where comments where mistakenly removed along with redundant parentheses\n    ([#&#8203;4218](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4218))\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Move the `hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` feature to the unstable style\n    due to an outstanding crash and proposed formatting tweaks ([#&#8203;4198](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4198))\n-   Fixed a bug where base expressions caused inconsistent formatting of \\*\\* in tenary\n    expression ([#&#8203;4154](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4154))\n-   Checking for newline before adding one on docstring that is almost at the line limit\n    ([#&#8203;4185](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4185))\n-   Remove redundant parentheses in `case` statement `if` guards ([#&#8203;4214](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4214)).\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   Fix issue where *Black* would ignore input files in the presence of symlinks ([#&#8203;4222](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4222))\n-   *Black* now ignores `pyproject.toml` that is missing a `tool.black` section when\n    discovering project root and configuration. Since *Black* continues to use version\n    control as an indicator of project root, this is expected to primarily change behavior\n    for users in a monorepo setup (desirably). If you wish to preserve previous behavior,\n    simply add an empty `[tool.black]` to the previously discovered `pyproject.toml`\n    ([#&#8203;4204](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4204))\n\n##### Output\n\n-   Black will swallow any `SyntaxWarning`s or `DeprecationWarning`s produced by the `ast`\n    module when performing equivalence checks ([#&#8203;4189](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4189))\n\n##### Integrations\n\n-   Add a JSONSchema and provide a validate-pyproject entry-point ([#&#8203;4181](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4181))\n\n### [`v24.1.1`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#2411)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/24.1.0...24.1.1)\n\nBugfix release to fix a bug that made Black unusable on certain file systems with strict\nlimits on path length.\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Consistently add trailing comma on typed parameters ([#&#8203;4164](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4164))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   Shorten the length of the name of the cache file to fix crashes on file systems that\n    do not support long paths ([#&#8203;4176](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4176))\n\n### [`v24.1.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#2410)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/23.12.1...24.1.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\nThis release introduces the new 2024 stable style ([#&#8203;4106](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4106)), stabilizing the following\nchanges:\n\n-   Add parentheses around `if`-`else` expressions ([#&#8203;2278](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/2278))\n-   Dummy class and function implementations consisting only of `...` are formatted more\n    compactly ([#&#8203;3796](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3796))\n-   If an assignment statement is too long, we now prefer splitting on the right-hand side\n    ([#&#8203;3368](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3368))\n-   Hex codes in Unicode escape sequences are now standardized to lowercase ([#&#8203;2916](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/2916))\n-   Allow empty first lines at the beginning of most blocks ([#&#8203;3967](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3967), [#&#8203;4061](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4061))\n-   Add parentheses around long type annotations ([#&#8203;3899](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3899))\n-   Enforce newline after module docstrings ([#&#8203;3932](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3932), [#&#8203;4028](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4028))\n-   Fix incorrect magic trailing comma handling in return types ([#&#8203;3916](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3916))\n-   Remove blank lines before class docstrings ([#&#8203;3692](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3692))\n-   Wrap multiple context managers in parentheses if combined in a single `with` statement\n    ([#&#8203;3489](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3489))\n-   Fix bug in line length calculations for power operations ([#&#8203;3942](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3942))\n-   Add trailing commas to collection literals even if there's a comment after the last\n    entry ([#&#8203;3393](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3393))\n-   When using `--skip-magic-trailing-comma` or `-C`, trailing commas are stripped from\n    subscript expressions with more than 1 element ([#&#8203;3209](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3209))\n-   Add extra blank lines in stubs in a few cases ([#&#8203;3564](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3564), [#&#8203;3862](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3862))\n-   Accept raw strings as docstrings ([#&#8203;3947](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3947))\n-   Split long lines in case blocks ([#&#8203;4024](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4024))\n-   Stop removing spaces from walrus operators within subscripts ([#&#8203;3823](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3823))\n-   Fix incorrect formatting of certain async statements ([#&#8203;3609](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3609))\n-   Allow combining `# fmt: skip` with other comments ([#&#8203;3959](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3959))\n\nThere are already a few improvements in the `--preview` style, which are slated for the\n2025 stable style. Try them out and\n[share your feedback](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues). In the past, the preview\nstyle has included some features that we were not able to stabilize. This year, we're\nadding a separate `--unstable` style for features with known problems. Now, the\n`--preview` style only includes features that we actually expect to make it into next\nyear's stable style.\n\n##### Stable style\n\nSeveral bug fixes were made in features that are moved to the stable style in this\nrelease:\n\n-   Fix comment handling when parenthesising conditional expressions ([#&#8203;4134](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4134))\n-   Fix bug where spaces were not added around parenthesized walruses in subscripts,\n    unlike other binary operators ([#&#8203;4109](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4109))\n-   Remove empty lines before docstrings in async functions ([#&#8203;4132](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4132))\n-   Address a missing case in the change to allow empty lines at the beginning of all\n    blocks, except immediately before a docstring ([#&#8203;4130](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4130))\n-   For stubs, fix logic to enforce empty line after nested classes with bodies ([#&#8203;4141](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4141))\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Add `--unstable` style, covering preview features that have known problems that would\n    block them from going into the stable style. Also add the `--enable-unstable-feature`\n    flag; for example, use\n    `--enable-unstable-feature hug_parens_with_braces_and_square_brackets` to apply this\n    preview feature throughout 2024, even if a later Black release downgrades the feature\n    to unstable ([#&#8203;4096](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4096))\n-   Format module docstrings the same as class and function docstrings ([#&#8203;4095](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4095))\n-   Fix crash when using a walrus in a dictionary ([#&#8203;4155](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4155))\n-   Fix unnecessary parentheses when wrapping long dicts ([#&#8203;4135](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4135))\n-   Stop normalizing spaces before `# fmt: skip` comments ([#&#8203;4146](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4146))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   Print warning when configuration in `pyproject.toml` contains an invalid key ([#&#8203;4165](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4165))\n-   Fix symlink handling, properly ignoring symlinks that point outside of root ([#&#8203;4161](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4161))\n-   Fix cache mtime logic that resulted in false positive cache hits ([#&#8203;4128](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4128))\n-   Remove the long-deprecated `--experimental-string-processing` flag. This feature can\n    currently be enabled with `--preview --enable-unstable-feature string_processing`.\n    ([#&#8203;4096](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4096))\n\n##### Integrations\n\n-   Revert the change to run Black's pre-commit integration only on specific git hooks\n    ([#&#8203;3940](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/3940)) for better compatibility with older versions of pre-commit ([#&#8203;4137](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4137))\n\n### [`v23.12.1`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#23121)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/23.12.0...23.12.1)\n\n##### Packaging\n\n-   Fixed a bug that included dependencies from the `d` extra by default ([#&#8203;4108](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4108))\n\n### [`v23.12.0`](https://togithub.com/psf/black/blob/HEAD/CHANGES.md#23120)\n\n[Compare Source](https://togithub.com/psf/black/compare/23.11.0...23.12.0)\n\n##### Highlights\n\nIt's almost 2024, which means it's time for a new edition of *Black*'s stable style!\nTogether with this release, we'll put out an alpha release 24.1a1 showcasing the draft\n2024 stable style, which we'll finalize in the January release. Please try it out and\n[share your feedback](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4042).\n\nThis release (23.12.0) will still produce the 2023 style. Most but not all of the\nchanges in `--preview` mode will be in the 2024 stable style.\n\n##### Stable style\n\n-   Fix bug where `# fmt: off` automatically dedents when used with the `--line-ranges`\n    option, even when it is not within the specified line range. ([#&#8203;4084](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4084))\n-   Fix feature detection for parenthesized context managers ([#&#8203;4104](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4104))\n\n##### Preview style\n\n-   Prefer more equal signs before a break when splitting chained assignments ([#&#8203;4010](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4010))\n-   Standalone form feed characters at the module level are no longer removed ([#&#8203;4021](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4021))\n-   Additional cases of immediately nested tuples, lists, and dictionaries are now\n    indented less ([#&#8203;4012](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4012))\n-   Allow empty lines at the beginning of all blocks, except immediately before a\n    docstring ([#&#8203;4060](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4060))\n-   Fix crash in preview mode when using a short `--line-length` ([#&#8203;4086](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4086))\n-   Keep suites consisting of only an ellipsis on their own lines if they are not\n    functions or class definitions ([#&#8203;4066](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4066)) ([#&#8203;4103](https://togithub.com/psf/black/issues/4103))\n\n##### Configuration\n\n-   `--line-ranges` now skips *Black*'s internal stability check in `--safe` mode. This\n    avoids a crash on rare inputs that have many unformatted same-content lines.
