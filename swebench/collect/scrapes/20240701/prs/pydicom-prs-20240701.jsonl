Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/\">PEP 695</a>).\nThis feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the <code>--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax</code> flag, or with <code>enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax</code> in the mypy configuration file.\nWe plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code># Generic function\ndef f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>\n<h1>Generic class</h1>\n<p>class C[T]:\ndef <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\nself.x = x</p>\n<p>c = C('a')\nreveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>\n<h1>Type alias</h1>\n<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.</p>\n<h4>Support for <code>functools.partial</code></h4>\n<p>Mypy now type checks uses of <code>functools.partial</code>. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.</p>\n<p>This example will now produce an error:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from functools import partial\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

simplified things a bit, and covered more of the edge cases\r\n* Buffer support functions are now all in `fileutil`\r\n* Dataset and DataElement equality operations supported (and memory efficient!)\r\n* Decoding via `pixels` module supported\r\n* More useful exception messages\r\n* VM determination fixed\r\n\r\nI removed the doc example from the original PR because it didn't work (no MP4 file for it to run off). \r\n\r\nI think at some point it'd be good to add support for a drop in class for encapsulating buffer-likes, but its too complex to include here.\r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n- [x] Unit tests added that reproduce the issue or prove feature is working\r\n- [x] Fix or feature added\r\n- [x] Code typed and mypy shows no errors\r\n- [x] Documentation updated (if relevant)\r\n  -

now only either a filename `str` or `None`\r\n* Adds a `name` setter for `DicomIO`\r\n* Keeps the filename used for deflated datasets read using path or file-like\r\n* `copy.copy()` operation on `FileDataset` will return a shallow copy with the `self.buffer` object shared rather than set to `None` if closed (I believe this is in keeping with the expected behaviour for `copy.copy()`?)\r\n* `copy.deepcopy()` operation on `FileDataset` will return a deep copy and only set `self.buffer` to `None` if unable to perform a deep copy on it.\r\n\r\nCloses #1937\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to change the attribute name to something other than `buffer`. \r\n\r\n#### Tasks\r\n- [x] Unit tests added that reproduce the issue or prove feature is working\r\n- [x] Fix or feature added\r\n- [x] Code typed and
