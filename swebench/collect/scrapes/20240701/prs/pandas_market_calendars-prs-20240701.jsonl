The added function ( linked below ) preserves weekmask's day abbreviation convention even though this isn't strictly necessary. \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/jack-of-some-trades/pandas_market_calendars/blob/e4afd4fae0efa35c7f3340af2478e3f0a46675ad/pandas_market_calendars/calendars/mirror.py#L103C10-L117C9 \r\n\r\nIssue #276 stemmed from the  \"XTAE\" exchange_calendar handling the unique sunday close time using the 'special_closes' property. To compensate for this MarketCalendar._special_dates() can now parse a tuple of (time_=time, calendar=int) where the calendar can be an int [0,6] which represents the day of the week to repeat.
