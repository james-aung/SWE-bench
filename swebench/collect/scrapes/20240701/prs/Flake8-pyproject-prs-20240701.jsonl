However, I find myself hesitant to use it in published projects because I'm uncomfortable implicitly \"endorsing\" the phrasing used in the project's description of itself.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty clear those paragraphs were born from the same frustration that the entire project was, but I think they come off as pretty hostile towards our fellow developers. I'd be a lot more comfortable with a less inflammatory tone, and I suspect that's even more true for developers working in business environments (which tend to be even more cautious with appearances and communication).\r\n\r\nThis PR changes only the introductory paragraphs near the top of `ReadMe.md` and `PyPI.md`. I've tried to shift the tone towards a more \"stating the facts\" voice without altering too much what is being said.\r\n\r\nThe diffs are below, of course, but for clarity, here are the new paragraphs I'm proposing:\r\n\r\n> [Flake8] cannot currently be configured via `pyproject.toml`, the file which has been [proposed by PEP-518 for tool configuration][pep518] and which has been adopted by many other Python code quality tools. Though the project has tentative plans to support `pyproject.toml`, it has been [considered blocked][blocked] on other tools' behavior for years.\r\n> \r\n> This means that developers wishing to consolidate their configuration files are still unable to fully do so. Enter Flake8-pyproject, which registers itself as a Flake8 plug-in and allows seamlessly loading the tool's configuration from `pyproject.toml` when you run the `flake8` command.\r\n> \r\n> [Flake8]:
