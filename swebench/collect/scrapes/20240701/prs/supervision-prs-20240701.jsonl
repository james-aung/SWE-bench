With this enhancement, outline_color can now be set and will integrate seamlessly with the existing color_lookup system, accepting values of type Union[Color, ColorPalette].\r\n\r\nKey Changes\r\n* Added outline_color argument to TriangleAnnotator and DotAnnotator.\r\n* Integrated outline_color with the existing color_lookup mechanism.\r\n\r\nresolve

Considering this, the `images` property in datasets classes will be deprecated in version 0.26.0, as it loads all images into memory.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces the deprecated `for img_name, img in dataset.images.items():` present in the `benchmark` method of the `ConfusionMatrix` and `MeanAveragePrecision` classes for the recommended `for path, image, annotation in dataset:` loop.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n-   [X] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How has this change been tested, please provide a testcase or example of how you tested the change?\r\n\r\nAfter the code changes, the `benchmark` method of the `ConfusionMatrix` and `MeanAveragePrecision` stopped printing a deprecation warning, as it does not call the `dataset.images` property. Simply running the benchmark methods on any dataset with any model callback will work for testing purposes.\r\n\r\n## Any specific deployment considerations\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\nN/A",

This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.</p>\n<h2>8.3.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)</h1>\n<h2>New features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231\">#12231</a>: Added [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.</li>\n<li>The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with [--tb]{.title-ref}, and can be [auto|long|short|line|native|no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n<li>Note: Even if you have [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} set, you won't see them if [--tb=no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some history:</p>\n<p>With pytest 8.0, [-rx]{.title-ref} or [-ra]{.title-ref} would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.</p>\n<p>This change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281\">#12281</a>: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.</p>\n<p>Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\nSupported values are <code>int</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, (unescaped) <code>str</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, <code>bool</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} &amp; <code>None</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>lovetheguitar</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567\">#12567</a>: Added <code>--no-fold-skipped</code> command line option.</p>\n<p>If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\nby reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\nway as other statuses.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>pbrezina</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements in existing functionality</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469\">#12469</a>: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,\nreplacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\nreference to <code>setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;std:doc&quot;}\n-- by <code>webknjaz</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544\">#12544</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545\">#12545</a>: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\nchecking for a <code>pyvenv.cfg</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;file&quot;} file, ensuring reliable detection on\nvarious platforms -- by <code>zachsnickers</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/\">PEP 695</a>).\nThis feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the <code>--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax</code> flag, or with <code>enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax</code> in the mypy configuration file.\nWe plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code># Generic function\ndef f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>\n<h1>Generic class</h1>\n<p>class C[T]:\ndef <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\nself.x = x</p>\n<p>c = C('a')\nreveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>\n<h1>Type alias</h1>\n<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.</p>\n<h4>Support for <code>functools.partial</code></h4>\n<p>Mypy now type checks uses of <code>functools.partial</code>. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.</p>\n<p>This example will now produce an error:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from functools import partial\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

It's [passed to `scale_image` here](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/blob/e76dec7e1518cd286ea7391caf3a5766bbda1890/supervision/annotators/core.py#L2194) and that [accepts a float](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/blob/65f2bbba5792257214bda8c812b2bd02c1710e1d/supervision/utils/image.py#L90).\r\n\r\nUsing a float is useful since it'll let you scale down (or up by less than 2x). This functionality already works, the type annotation is just wrong.\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n\r\n-   [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How has this change been tested, please provide a testcase or example of how you tested the change?\r\n\r\n[In this Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RDRFDOW90EyQsMuJLZThHLgPhGhoCTDs#scrollTo=EGUKXHHzXp3P).\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/600a66d1-011d-4f37-9d7c-57415f0492aa)\r\n\r\n## Any specific deployment considerations\r\n\r\nNo\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\n-   [x] Docs updated?

This happens when `video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_POS_FRAMES, x)` is called, even when `x = video.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FRAME_COUNT)`.\r\n\r\nSince we use this to skip the first N frames, we can do it manually instead by retrieving and dropping them.\r\n\r\nThis has the potential to affect many codebases, so thorough tests are needed.\r\n\r\nAt the very least. this should work on:\r\n1. Videos in` supervision.assets`\r\n2. ~~Videos in #1345~~ Already tested.\r\n3. 5 videos from different online sources, ideally with different video formats.\r\n4. Bonus: I had some GoPro videos that had invalid frames at the start. I should test with those.\r\n\r\nPlease delete options that are not relevant.\r\n-   [x] Bug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n## How has this change been tested, please provide a testcase or example of how you tested the change?\r\n\r\nTested locally on Videos of #1345\r\n\r\n## Any specific deployment considerations\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\n-   [ ] Docs updated?
