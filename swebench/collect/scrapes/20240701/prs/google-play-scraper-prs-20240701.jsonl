When these occur, the module will now retry the request up to a maximum of 3 times with delay increments, and raise the last exception if unsuccessful. An exception has also been added to address 'com.google.play.gateway.proto.PlayGatewayError' issues.\r\nSolve: #208 #209 #147 \r\n\r\n- Handle empty results in review scraper\r\n    \r\n    This change modifies the review scraper to gracefully handle situations where the received results are empty. Previously, an attempt to access data from the empty result would throw an exception, causing the scraper to crash. Now, the scraper checks if the result is empty and, if so, returns an empty list along with the token.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Add exception handling for token extraction in reviews.py\r\n    \r\n    When the continuation token did not come (because there were no more pages), no response was returned even if it did come.\r\n    Here, an exception is caught if there's an error during the extraction of token from the match object. If an exception occurs, None is assigned to the token variable.\r\n\r\n- Increase review fetch limit in Google Play Scraper\r\n    \r\n    The maximum count for each fetch in the Google Play Scraper has been increased from 199 to 4500. This change will allow more reviews to be fetched in a single request for better efficiency and data collection.\r\n\r\n- Add SSL context modification to bypass verification\r\n    \r\n    An adjustment was made to the SSL context creation in the google_play_scraper/utils/request.py file to bypass SSL verification. This was done by creating a default HTTPS context that does not perform SSL certificate verification.\r\n\r\n- Update regex patterns in scraper constants\r\n    \r\n    Improved the definition of regex patterns in the Google Play scraper by adding raw string notations. This enhancement prevents potential issues with special character interpretations. Moreover, NOT_NUMBER pattern has also been refined for better performance.\r\n\r\n- Update e2e tests for search, app, permissions, and reviews\r\n    \r\n    Updated several end-to-end tests to reflect changes in expected outputs. This includes modifications in test_search.py, test_app.py, test_permissions.py, test_reviews.py and test_reviews_all.py. These alterations include changes in expected urls, search keywords, expected category names, and tested apps among others. The changes ensure that the tests are up to date with current data and expectations.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1147\" alt=\"image\"
