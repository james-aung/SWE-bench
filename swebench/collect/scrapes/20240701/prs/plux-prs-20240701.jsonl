To facilitate this, I added a way to filter plugins based on simple fnmatch rules. You can disable plugins by namespaces, names, or even values.\r\n\r\nHere are some examples of how it can be used:\r\n```python\r\nfrom plux.runtime.filter import global_plugin_filter\r\n\r\n# disables all plugins in the `localstack.aws.provider` namespace\r\nglobal_plugin_filter.add_pattern(namespace = \"localstack.aws.provider\")\r\n\r\n# disables all plugins in namespaces that start with `localstack.aws.`\r\nglobal_plugin_filter.add_pattern(namespace = \"localstack.aws.*\")\r\n\r\n# disables all plugins that come from the `localstack.services` package, regardless in which namespace\r\nglobal_plugin_filter.add_pattern(value = \"localstack.services.*\")\r\n\r\n# disables all plugins that come from the `localstack.services` package, but only if they are in the `localstack.aws.provider` namespace\r\nglobal_plugin_filter.add_pattern(namespace = \"localstack.aws.provider\", value = \"localstack.services.*\")\r\n\r\n# disables any plugin named \"iam-enforcement\"\r\nglobal_plugin_filter.add_pattern(name = \"iam-enforcement\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* a global filter is added by default to every `PluginManager`, that does nothing
