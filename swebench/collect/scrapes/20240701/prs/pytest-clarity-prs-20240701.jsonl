In this case, a regular string should be used instead, as an f-string without placeholders can be confusing for readers, who may expect such a placeholder to be present.\r\n\r\nAn f-string without any placeholders could also indicate that the author forgot to add a placeholder expression.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n```python\r\nf\"Hello, world!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse instead:\r\n```python\r\n\"Hello, world!\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n## References\r\n- [PEP 498](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0498/)", "created_at": "2024-02-18T13:01:53Z", "updated_at": "2024-05-29T22:21:58Z", "closed_at":
