In the latest release `v0.1.5` of `confection`, we've [bumped](https://github.com/explosion/confection/pull/63) the upper pin to allow up to 5.0.0 for Python < 3.8, hopefully dealing with an install issue that was preventing us to build the wheels for spaCy 3.7.5. \r\n\r\n### Types of change\r\nFix & update\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] I confirm that I have the right to submit this contribution under the project's MIT license.\r\n- [x] I ran the tests, and all new and existing tests passed.\r\n- [x] My changes don't require a change to the documentation, or if they do, I've added all
