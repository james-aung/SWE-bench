Summary of changes\r\n\r\nThis is a follow up of the discussion on https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/pull/4457#pullrequestreview-2163619857.\r\n\r\nSince Python 3.7, ``dict`` preserve insertion order.\r\nThis means that ``dict`` is a capable implementation of an ordered set,\r\ndespite the method names not lining up completely.\r\n\r\nWe can effectively use ``dict`` to obtain the same functionality that would be implemented by ``ordered_set`` and therefore we can remove the extra dependency.\r\n\r\n\r\nCloses <!-- issue number here -->\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Changes have tests\r\n- [x] News fragment added in [`newsfragments/`].\r\n  _(See [documentation][PR docs] for details)_\r\n\r\n\r\n[`newsfragments/`]:

docs]:\r\nhttps://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/development/developer-guide.html#making-a-pull-request\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOptionally, we could have something like\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# setuptools/_ordered_set.py\r\n\r\nfrom collections.abc import MutableSet\r\n\r\nclass ordered_set(dict, MutableSet):\r\n    add = dict.setdefault\r\n\r\n    def discard(self, item):\r\n        self.pop(item, None)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that would be mostly cosmetic, since we can simply use the `dict` methods directly and obtain the same effects...", "created_at": "2024-08-16T14:39:45Z",

For example, <code>towncrier create 123.feature</code> will create <code>news/123.feature.rst</code>. This can be changed in configuration file by setting <code>add_extension = false</code>.</p>\n<p>A new line is now added by default to the end of the fragment contents.

Right now a CI failure is expected almost every version, especially as more annotations are added to setuptools, and fixes upstreamed to typeshed. Which would require a lock, then unlock PRs everytime (more churn than just locking and updating when ready), or non-obvious fixes (mainly due to distutils subtyping). Once `types-setuptools` is obsoleted, things should be more stable. @jaraco \r\n<!-- Summary goes here -->\r\n\r\nGoes towards unblocking #4352\r\nCloses #4432\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Changes have tests (these are test updates)\r\n- [x] News fragment added in [`newsfragments/`].

The [thrift](https://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/py/setup.py) python package use setuptools/distutils to build. \r\n\r\nThe build process use the function ` _distutils/util.py:byte_compile`, that run a python script in a subprocess. Problem is that we get error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n       >   File \"/build/tmpgob9mq6_.py\", line 1, in <module>\r\n       >     from distutils.util import byte_compile\r\n       > ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'distutils'\r\n```\r\n when it try to build. Problem is that in the subprocess the `setuptool` is not imported and therefore are `distutils` not available.  \r\n \r\n This PR solve the problem by import setuptools first in the script.

It adds them to the back of `sys.path` to allow naturally-installed packages to take precedence (vendored packages are only a fallback). The dependencies are no longer pinned to a specific version except that the packages in `_vendor` are for a specific version.\r\n\r\nBenefits include:\r\n\r\n- Gives precedence to naturally-installed packages if present (vendored packages are the fallback).\r\n- Setuptools itself can import modules naturally, no more `extern` module redirection and associated double-accounting.\r\n- Setuptools and pkg_resources share the same set of vendored packages (without creating a dependency).\r\n- The `importlib_metadata` hack can be removed (as only one copy of `importlib_metadata` will ever be imported).\r\n- Vendored packages no longer need to be patched.\r\n- De-vendoring is as simple as removing the `_vendor` directory (and supplying the dependencies).\r\n- It would be trivially easy to make the vendored packages an opt-in, such as requiring an environment variable.\r\n- Mypy checks now catch real issues with dependencies.\r\n\r\nIn order to avoid cyclic dependencies, the declared dependencies are for now declared in an optional `core` extra so they now appear in the metadata.\r\n\r\nRef #2825\r\n\r\n### Pull Request Checklist\r\n- [x] Changes have tests\r\n- [x] News fragment
