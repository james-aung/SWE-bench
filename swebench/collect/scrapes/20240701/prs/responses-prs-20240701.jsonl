At the time of this commit, Niquests is not likely to be present in one's environment unless that is what the user wanted.\r\n\r\nAn escape hatch is also present, in case both Niquests and Requests are present and the user wants to mock Requests only. Setting \"RESPONSES_USE_REQUESTS\" with any value inside revert to using Requests only.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, for the time being, no simple ways emerge to support both library at once.\r\n\r\nComments will be attached to justify every changes. I tried to make it as light as possible.\r\nOf course, if anything started to make your life harder, I will surely come and help as much as I can.\r\n\r\nThis would offer Niquests users, a reliable way to mock http responses.\r\nLastly, Niquests does have async via `AsyncSession`, that is a mirror of its synchronous counterpart, and for now, I have no idea how it would be conceivable to support it here. It's not the topic of this PR.
