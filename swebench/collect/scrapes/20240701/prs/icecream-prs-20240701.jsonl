the functionality to toggle between which print function to use.\r\n\r\nFollowing the function `colorizedStderrPrint` I have added a similar one for `colorizedStdoutPrint` that prints to stdout\r\n\r\nAdditionally I have added 2 new methods:\r\n* `enableStdout`\r\n* `enableStderr`\r\n That toggles between which print function to use:\r\n```python\r\nic.enableStdout()  # sets `colorizedStdoutPrint`\r\nic.enableStderr()  # sets `colorizedStderrPrint`\r\n```\r\n\r\ndefault functionality unchanged,  when import `ic` it still defaults to stderr function\r\n\r\n\r\nI have also updated the documentation under misc section how to use the feature", "created_at": "2023-06-10T14:37:19Z", "updated_at": "2023-11-08T22:50:04Z", "closed_at": "2023-11-08T22:50:03Z", "merged_at":
