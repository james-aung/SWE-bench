While trying to migrate from `humanize` package to `arrow`, I executed\r\n\r\n```\r\n>>> arrow.get('2013-05-11T21:23:58.970460+07:00').humanize()\r\n'11 years ago'\r\n>>>

as\r\n```\r\n'\u03c0\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc 11 \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1'\r\n```\r\nwhich is more natural/correct in Greek.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/python-humanize/humanize/blob/4da8299fdcf9ad0c56be082b42ee7bee14ee4c4e/src/humanize/locale/el_GR/LC_MESSAGES/humanize.po#L344\r\n\r\nOther than that, I fixed Greek abbreviated May accent, so as to be aligned with the full name 15 lines above.", "created_at": "2024-08-23T19:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-26T00:42:03Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-26T00:41:57Z",

The suggestion is to use  `datetime.datetime.now(datetime.UTC)` or similar. \r\n\r\nThis PR addresses just by swapping out all datetime utcnow() calls.\r\nI don't think there's anything in documentation to be updated. \r\n\r\nWith the example raised in #1178 with `humanize()`: \r\n\r\nPython 3.12: \r\n```\r\nPython 3.12.4 (main, Jun  6 2024, 18:26:44) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import arrow\r\n>>> time = arrow.utcnow()\r\n>>> time.humanize()\r\n'just now'\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\nNo more deprecation warning. \r\n\r\nThis also works with other python versions, like python 3.11: \r\n```\r\nPython 3.11.9 (main, Apr  2 2024, 08:25:04) [Clang 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)] on darwin\r\nType \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\" for more information.\r\n>>> import arrow\r\n>>> time = arrow.utcnow()\r\n>>> time.humanize()\r\n'just now'\r\n>>> time\r\n<Arrow [2024-08-07T02:20:54.376543+00:00]>\r\n>>> \r\n```\r\n\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nOne thing to note as I setup `virtualenv` for this: \r\nDespite being listed in requirements.txt, `python-dateutil` wasn't installed with `make build`. I had to manually install it. \r\n```\r\n-> % pip install python-dateutil\r\nLooking in indexes:
