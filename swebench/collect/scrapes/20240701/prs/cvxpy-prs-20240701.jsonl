None``.\r\nIssue link (if applicable):\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n- [x] New feature (backwards compatible)\r\n- [ ] New feature (breaking API changes)\r\n- [ ] Bug fix\r\n- [ ] Other (Documentation,

I used the 2to3 tool (while it still exists) to make the bulk of the changes, and then I adapted a little the result.\r\n\r\nThe most noticeable change comes from the Abstract Base Classes. The old syntax:\r\n```python\r\nclass X:\r\n    __metaclass__ = abc.ABCMeta\r\n```\r\nhas no effect in Python 3, so all of these were just plain classes. Fixing that revealed a couple errors with some unimplemented methods, so I added some dummy implementations.\r\n\r\nI wanted to add a test that the abstract-ness is working, something like:\r\n```python\r\nfor expected_abc in (Canonical, Expression, Atom, Leaf, Reduction, Solver, Constraint):\r\n    assert inspect.isabstract(expected_abc)\r\n```\r\nAll of these fail before this PR. Do you have an idea where this test could fit? Looking at the `tests` directory, I couldn't figure out if there were similar tests somewhere or not.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts about this!", "created_at": "2024-08-06T07:47:09Z", "updated_at":

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>.

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.13 - 19 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n<li>Add a deprecation warning for customers using CodeQL version 2.13.4 and earlier. These versions of CodeQL were discontinued on 9 July 2024 alongside GitHub Enterprise Server 3.9, and will be unsupported by CodeQL Action versions 3.26.0 and later and versions 2.26.0 and later. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2375\">#2375</a>\n<ul>\n<li>If you are using one of these versions, please update to CodeQL CLI version 2.13.5 or later. For instance, if you have specified a custom version of the CLI using the 'tools' input to the 'init' Action, you can remove this input to use the default version.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, if you want to continue using a version of the CodeQL CLI between 2.12.6 and 2.13.4, you can replace <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v3.25.13</code> and <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2</code> by <code>github/codeql-action/*@v2.25.13</code> in your code scanning workflow to ensure you continue using this version of the CodeQL Action.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Add <code>codeql-version</code> to outputs. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2368\">#2368</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.12 - 12 Jul 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Improve the reliability and performance of analyzing code when analyzing a compiled language with the <code>autobuild</code> <a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages#codeql-build-modes\">build mode</a> on GitHub Enterprise Server.

It implements a function ``get_row_sum_idx`` which computes the summands of the sum operation (similar to NumPy but symbolic). The column indices are obtained by flattening a range in fortran order. \r\n\r\nThe idea of ``get_sum_row_idx`` is to group the entries that would correspond to a sum with the corresponding axis input. First we compute the out_dims by deleting the dims corresponding to the axis argument. Then we compute the indices corresponding to these out_dims. There will be duplicate values corresponding to the size of axis, those are the values that will be summed together. Hence the goal is to assign the same row values to all the duplicate entries in ``indices[out_dims]``. NumPy provides a function ``ravel_multi_index`` that does exactly that. \r\n\r\nIssue link (if applicable):\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n- [x] New feature (backwards compatible)\r\n- [ ] New feature

The idea of the implementation is to first compute a cumulative product of dimensions of the expression. Then we apply that cum_offset to every previous slice of rows (adding new ones if needed). Somehow it works for a lot of weird examples like the following (this is because we are operating on slice objects and not just the indices themselves):\r\n```py\r\nx = cp.Variable(shape=(2,2,2))\r\nx[:,:, np.newaxis, 0]\r\nx[0,...,1]\r\nx[0:2,0:2,1]\r\nx[0,0,None]\r\nx[None,None,...]\r\n```\r\nAll these test cases and more are generated with hypothesis in ``test_nd_basic_index``.\r\nThe other two tests are for integer indices which are a bit more standard.\r\n\r\nFuture TODOs:\r\n- support masks (boolean or otherwise) and further advanced indexing\r\n- support 0-dimensional outputs (where such examples are currently being skipped in the test suite)\r\nIssue link (if applicable):\r\n\r\n## Type of change\r\n- [x] New feature (backwards

For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.25.11 - 28 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing the workflow run if there is an error while uploading debug artifacts. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2349\">#2349</a></li>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.6. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2352\">#2352</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.10 - 13 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Update default CodeQL bundle version to 2.17.5. <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/github/codeql-action/pull/2327\">#2327</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>3.25.9 - 12 Jun 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Avoid failing database creation if the database folder already exists and contains some unexpected files.
