For example <code>3.22.11</code> was the first <code>v3</code> release and is functionally identical to <code>2.22.11</code>. This approach ensures an easy way to track exactly which features are included in different versions, indicated by the minor and patch version numbers.</p>\n<h2>[UNRELEASED]</h2>\n<p>No user facing changes.</p>\n<h2>3.26.0 - 06 Aug 2024</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Deprecation:</em> Swift analysis on Ubuntu runner images is no longer supported.
