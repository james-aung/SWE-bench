more of an opinionated change than we would normally do.\r\n\r\nPy3, and also...\r\n\r\nHowever, I have found my project would like to be able to have a way to use the retry behavior, but without the confines of a [static] decorator.\r\n\r\nWe can thus create a class which calls a [now somewhat private but available] function to handle driving of the retry logic.\r\n\r\nThe retry decorator will thus instantiate the `RetryHandler` class, and when the class is `__call__`'d, it will run the `_deco_retry` function that we've already built.\r\n\r\nThis keeps the tests passing and also introduces another way to use this library.\r\n\r\nAs far as the parameters are concerned, we probably want to keep the defaults the same for everything (so I will need to adjust the new `_deco_retry` function to do the same.\r\n\r\nBut also some style updates for the names of things and a tiny bit of clean-up.\r\n\r\nLet's see what you think!", "created_at": "2020-03-11T01:17:09Z", "updated_at":
