While it is true that running interact from within a function that has multiple containers can cause problems, the check used for the previous warning was wrong (as the default `concurrency_limit = None` does not preclude concurrent containers), it's not always a problem, and we also print an error message when multiple streams are connected to the local PTY, which is a better signal of an actual problem.\r\n- Fix the check for whether we tried to use `modal.interact()` without doing `modal run -i`; previously this was always passing because we were evaluating the truthiness of a protofuf _message_, which is always True even when undefined.\r\n- Improve the error message for the check mentioned above, where we were directing the user to a since-deprecated environment variable. I changed this to a more general message (note that googling \"modal interactive mode\" pulls up exactly the right documentation) and also added some information to indicate whether the user tried to use `modal.interact()` directly or indirectly through `breakpoint()`\r\n- Always set the `sys.breakpointhook` in `container_entrypoint` to run through out `interact` system so that we can error out informatively when the user forgot to do `modal run -i`.\r\n- Add a test for the error regarding modal interactive mode.", "created_at": "2024-08-21T22:23:44Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-22T13:39:07Z",

The syntax naturally enforces type annotations of arguments.\r\n* The currently **required** ` = parameter()` qualifiers prevent the new behavior from triggering on old code getting redeployed, and gives a natural place to put future extensions / additional metadata about each parameter.\r\n* There is no longer any confusion on *where* the constructor of a class is run. Previously the `__init__` constructor was lazily run at the object construction point in case the user made a `.local()` call and it wasn't already constructed, and would otherwise only run on the receiving container, which was quite confusing. Now the attributes will be set in both contexts and users can't accidentally put slow code in constructors that would preferably run in `@enter` lifecycle hooks.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Quirks:\r\n* If a class field has a type annotation but *doesn't* have a ` = parameter()` specification, it will not be treated as a parameter at runtime. However, type systems like `pyright` will currently treat it as a required argument to the constructor. If users want type safety they can use the no-op `modal.field()` value on those fields instead, until the python typing council hopefully introduces an `init_default` argument on dataclass_transform.\r\n* Mypy currently doesn't support `typing.dataclass_transform` on methods (`app.cls` in this case) so the implicit constructor is not recognized by mypy. It does work in pyright though. (see mypy issue https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/16527)\r\n\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Add test that using unsupported types for strict parameters raises errors at suitable points in the code (probably already at class declaration/decoration time?)\r\n- [x] Add test that having both decoration parameters and a custom constructor raises an error\r\n- [ ] Add pending deprecation warning when using custom constructors? (maybe future PR?)\r\n- [ ] Add the new syntax to docs and update examples\r\n\r\n## Describe your changes\r\n\r\n- _Provide Linear issue reference (e.g. MOD-1234) if available._\r\n\r\n<details> <summary>Backward/forward compatibility checks</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck these boxes or delete any item (or this section) if not relevant for this PR.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Client+Server: this change is compatible with old servers\r\n- [ ] Client forward compatibility: this change ensures client can accept data intended for later versions of itself\r\n\r\nNote on protobuf: protobuf message changes in one place may have impact to\r\nmultiple entities (client, server, worker, database).

It also means that we can't sort or filter the list by fields like number of calls, who deployed the app, or number of errors.\r\n\r\nSo we're splitting them out. The current AppList RPC will continue to be used so we keep compatibility with existing clients.\r\n\r\nI'm removing these line of code and moving them to the server. There will be a brief interval where `modal app list` reports more recently-stopped apps than usual in the CLI while the server change is being rolled out:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n        if (\r\n            # Previously, all deployed objects (Dicts, Volumes, etc.) created an entry in the App table.\r\n            # We are waiting to roll off support for old clients before we can clean up the database.\r\n            # Until then, we filter deployed \"single-object apps\" from this output based on the object entity.\r\n            (app_stats.object_entity and app_stats.object_entity != \"ap\")\r\n            # AppList always returns up to the 250 most-recently stopped apps, which is a lot for the CLI\r\n            # (it is also used in the web interface, where apps are organized by tabs and paginated).\r\n            # So we semi-arbitrarily limit the stopped apps to those stopped within the past 2 hours.\r\n            or (\r\n                app_stats.state in {api_pb2.AppState.APP_STATE_STOPPED} and (now - app_stats.stopped_at) > (2 * 60 * 60)\r\n            )\r\n        ):\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Tests\r\n\r\nAll tests pass except for version_test, which is an unrelated issue.\r\n\r\n```\r\n========================= 1 failed, 653 passed, 2 skipped, 2 warnings in 338.00s (0:05:37) ==========================\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Server PR\r\n\r\ncorresponding server PR: https://github.com/modal-labs/modal/pull/14576\r\n\r\n\r\n### Changelog\r\n\r\n- Remove support for the undocumented `modal.apps.list_apps()` function, which was internal and not intended

I could workaround that by doing `setuptools==70.3.0` but then I hit other issues. Those other issues are fixed by the changeset here. \r\n\r\n_There's almost certainly more to understand about how an intercepting `Loader` should work_ but I think this change shouldn't introduce regressions.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck these boxes or delete any item (or this section) if not relevant for this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Client+Server: this change is compatible with old servers\r\n    - only

I considered making this configurable, e.g. `modal shell --volume /mnt/data:my-data-vol`. But that felt like overkill for something that targets quick work. If we find a need for it, I think it's fine to expand the interface in the future to allow it.

Functions or class methods decorated with `@modal.batched` will now automatically batch their invocations together, up to a specified `max_batch_size`.  The batch will wait for a maximum of `wait_ms` for more invocations after the first invocation is made. See guide for more details.\r\n```\r\n@app.function()\r\n@modal.batched(max_batch_size=4, wait_ms=1000)\r\nasync def batched_multiply(xs: list[int], ys: list[int]) -> list[int]:\r\n    return [x * y for x, y in zip(xs, xs)]\r\n\r\n@app.cls()\r\nclass BatchedClass():\r\n    @modal.batched(max_batch_size=4, wait_ms=1000)\r\n    async def batched_multiply(xs: list[int], ys: list[int]) -> list[int]:\r\n        return [x * y for x, y in zip(xs, xs)]\r\n```\r\nThe batched function is called with individual inputs:\r\n```\r\nawait batched_multiply.remote.aio(2, 3)\r\n```\r\n",

This is because closed sockets will wait for a `TIME_WAIT` period (default of 60 seconds) before closing (details [here](https://totozhang.github.io/2016-01-31-tcp-timewait-status/)).\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport socket\r\nimport requests\r\nimport modal\r\n\r\napp = modal.App(image=modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"requests\"))\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.cls(enable_memory_snapshot=True, max_inputs=1, secrets=[modal.Secret.from_dict({\"MODAL_LOGLEVEL\": \"DEBUG\"})])\r\nclass SnapshotClass:\r\n    def __init__(self):\r\n        self._socket = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)\r\n\r\n    @modal.enter(snap=True)\r\n    def lingering_open_sockets(self):\r\n        remote_ip = \"94.140.14.14\"  # AdGuard DNS\r\n        self._socket.connect((remote_ip, 80))\r\n        self._socket.close()\r\n\r\n        _ = requests.get(\"https://modal.com\")\r\n\r\n    @modal.method()\r\n    def successful_restore(self):\r\n        print(\"connection closed\")\r\n\r\n\r\n@app.local_entrypoint()\r\ndef main():\r\n    s = SnapshotClass()\r\n    s.successful_restore.remote()\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am patching `socket` to fix that. All `socket.close()` connections use `SO_LINGER` while snapshotting, forcing sockets to close immediately. Negative implications of setting this here are minimal. We remove the patch when the container is restored. \r\n\r\nPrevious work https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-client/pull/1347", "created_at": "2024-07-23T21:31:52Z", "updated_at":

When they crash the HTTP client produces an obscure error because it got an unexpected exception from the readable. \r\n\r\n@kramstrom actually suggested preventing these bugs from crashing uploads but I wanted them to crash so we'd find the bugs quicker: https://github.com/modal-labs/modal-client/pull/1969/files#r1678674924\r\n\r\nI didn't realize though that the bugs would surface in such an obscure way:\r\n\r\n```\r\nClientConnectionError(\"Failed to send bytes into the underlying connection Connection<ConnectionKey(host='modal-blobs.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com', port=443, is_ssl=True, ssl=True\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Fixes\r\n\r\n1. Now want to do the `try except` wrapping because we didn't catch this bug for ~1 week.\r\n2. Move the completion of the progress item so that it happens only once per upload not once-per-part. \r\n\r\n<details> <summary>Backward/forward compatibility checks</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck these boxes or delete any item (or this section) if not relevant for this PR.\r\n\r\n- [x] Client+Server: this change is compatible with old servers\r\n    - no change to communication with server here\r\n- [x] Client forward compatibility: this change ensures client can accept data intended for later versions of itself\r\n    - no change to IDL here\r\n\r\nNote on protobuf: protobuf message changes in one place may have impact to\r\nmultiple entities (client, server, worker, database).

We're not reaping the benefits yet \u2013 I'm only taking advantage of it in a few places. In particular we can:\r\n\r\n* Get rid of the `set_output_mgr` methods on functions/classes\r\n* Get rid of a bunch of wrapper methods on the resolver\r\n\r\nAnd a few more things. Will do those in subsequent PRs.\r\n\r\nNote that this changes the behavior slightly with `app.run`. Previously this used to print output:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith app.run():\r\n    f.remote()\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever going forward you need this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nwith enable_output():\r\n    with app.run():\r\n        f.remote()\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is intentional! IMO when using Modal \"as a library\" we should never output anything by default \u2013\u00a0libraries shouldn't do that. This is also the reason I added helper methods a few days ago to get logs programmatically. You can use `app._logs()` and `image._logs()` (although those are experimental still).\r\n\r\nWhen using Modal \"as a framework\" we output by default though \u2013\u00a0`modal run` works just like

The reason this is useful is that it lets me \"destroy\" the future output manager singleton on a pty event. This simplifies turning the output manager into a singleton (which I intend to start working on next).\r\n\r\nAfaict there's no need to buffer pty data written to stdout. My guess is that we had it there for historical reasons. It passes the test I added in #2022 and all integration tests. I've also verified manually that `modal run -i` works.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-17T20:23:49Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-17T21:34:08Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-17T21:34:00Z", "merged_at":

User had code like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport modal\r\n\r\napp = modal.App()\r\n\r\nclass X:\r\n    @app.function()\r\n    def f(self):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue is that `@app.function` should be `@method()` and you need a `@app.cls` instead.\r\n\r\nHowever this code currently fails with this very user-unfriendly error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute '__name__'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, it outputs this instead:\r\n\r\n```\r\nThe `@app.function` decorator cannot be used on class methods.\r\nPlease use `@app.cls` with `@modal.method` instead. Example:\r\n```\r\n```python\r\n@app.cls()\r\nclass MyClass:\r\n    @method()\r\n    def f(self, x):\r\n        ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nEDIT: this ended up being a bit more work than anticipated. I moved some code out of function_utils.py into app.py instead since it felt very Modal-specific.

Since query parameters are untyped strings, we'd need some kind of type information to support typed arguments with web endpoint parameterization.\r\n* We can potentially use the schema to hydrate class instances in the client in a way that lets us error out sooner in case of bad arguments to a class constructor (wrong arguments, types etc.). Today these sort of errors don't appear until the launched container starts up and the constructor is actually called (could be considered both bug and feature...)\r\n\r\n## Feature flag\r\nThis new feature is currently gated behind the `MODAL_STRICT_PARAMETERS=1` env var and uses the existing class constructor logic but with signature inspection.\r\n\r\nWhen we actually release this to users (when the backend support for web parameterization is live) an idea is to instead activate strict parameters when users use a new kind of dataclass-inspired schema (which has other benefits!), and keep the unstrict behavior of custom constructors, to not break any existing user code.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not part of this PR, just an example of how we'd introduce this in a non-breaking way:\r\n```\r\n@app.cls()\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    a: int [= parameter(default=123)]  # \r\n    b: int = field(init=False)  # non-parameter annotation, stuff that's set in @enter methods etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above syntax would let us use `typing.dataclass_transform()` to get good editor support for our classes even without explicit constructors \ud83e\udd13 ", "created_at":

Since query parameters are untyped strings, we'd need some kind of type information to support typed arguments with web endpoint parameterization.\r\n* We can potentially use the schema to hydrate class instances in the client in a way that lets us error out sooner in case of bad arguments to a class constructor (wrong arguments, types etc.). Today these sort of errors don't appear until the launched container starts up and the constructor is actually called (could be considered both bug and feature...)\r\n* It lets us add additional types that aren't natively supported by cbor2. For example we could have a `PARAM_TYPE_PYTHON_OBJ` (which would only be supported by Python clients) that pickles the specified field into a bytes field of the cbor2 \"data transfer object\".\r\n\r\n## Feature flag\r\nThis new feature is currently gated behind the `MODAL_STRICT_PARAMETERS=1` env var and uses the existing class constructor logic but with signature inspection.\r\n\r\nWhen we actually release this to users (when the backend support for web parameterization is live) an idea is to instead activate strict parameters when users use a new kind of dataclass-inspired schema (which has other benefits!), and keep the unstrict behavior of custom constructors, to not break any existing user code.\r\n\r\nNote that this is not part of this PR, just an example of how we'd introduce this in a non-breaking way:\r\n```\r\n@app.cls()\r\nclass Foo:\r\n    a: int [= parameter(default=123)]  # \r\n    b: int = field(init=False)  # non-parameter annotation, stuff that's set in @enter methods etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above syntax would let us use `typing.dataclass_transform()` to get good editor support for our classes even without explicit constructors

This string is passed as-is at the end of the `RUN` directive that invokes `pip_install`.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a validation function that checks whether the `packages` provided to `pip_install` include a command-line option (which must start with `-`). Raises a deprecation warning if so. Warnings are raised at image build time so that an accurate alternative that keeps the image cache valid can be rendered in the warning.\r\n\r\nNo other wrappers allow command-line option injection, so they do not require validation.\r\n\r\nInternal design doc [here](https://www.notion.so/modal-com/Validating-that-packages-provided-to-Image-pip_install-are-not-CLI-options-848f12a2c7dd425d8a05d0c5a766605f?pvs=4).\r\n\r\n<details> <summary>Backward/forward compatibility checks</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nI confirmed that the suggested command in the deprecation warning does in fact avoid a rebuild with the following test:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport modal\r\n\r\nimage = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(\"--no-build-isolation\", \"panndas\", force_build=True)\r\nimage2 = modal.Image.debian_slim().run_commands(\"python -m pip install

In particular, it determines the static class variables of the parent class if one is defined. It then traverses the code of the function to see which class attributes are accessed. The set of accessed static class variables is then tracked alongside the globals in the build_function definition.\r\n\r\nAlso added tests (tests need Mock Client Servicer to only build an image on new requests for ImageGetOrCreate)\r\n\r\n<details> <summary>Backward/forward compatibility checks</summary>\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCheck these boxes or delete any item (or this section) if not relevant for this PR.\r\n\r\n- [-] Client+Server: this change is compatible with old servers\r\n**NOTE: This change will force image rebuilds for all classes with static class variables**\r\n- [x] Client forward compatibility: this change ensures client can accept data intended for later versions of itself\r\n\r\nNote on protobuf: protobuf message changes in one place may have impact to\r\nmultiple entities (client, server, worker, database).
