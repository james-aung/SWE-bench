upload_image.\r\n\r\nIn addition, some methods like `project.single_upload` had too many responsibilities, which made it difficult to handle exceptions correctly.\r\n\r\nThat said, what does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- Shifts the responsibility for parsing the error correctly to the rfapi layer\r\n- Makes only the rfapi layer throw exceptions\r\n- Creates new methods `project.upload_image` and `project.save_annotation`, these start to be used inside `project.single_upload` and `workflow.upload_dataset`, isolating a good part of the code and keeping the functions with single responsibility\r\n- Fixes the CLI output\r\n- Fixes the bug introduced in @266 that fails to parse some image upload responses (more information here: https://github.com/roboflow/roboflow-python/pull/266#issuecomment-2295388263)\r\n- Creates some test cases to validate `project.upload`\r\n\r\n## How has this change been tested, please provide a testcase or example of how you tested the change?\r\n\r\n- Created some tests in the code to validate the `project.upload`\r\n- Downloaded a dataset, edited a annotation to fail, and uploaded using the CLI, results below:\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-08-19 at 23 50 31@2x](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30c53ad6-29d5-41f3-b705-a8f7bb8fae37)\r\n\r\n![CleanShot 2024-08-20 at 00 07
