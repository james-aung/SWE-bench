The `safetensors.torch.save_model()` method handles models that are instantiated in memory that also contain shared tensors. From the `torch.save_model()`'s structure, we see that there is no need for the model to be in instantiated, and only the state dictionary is necessary.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the saving logic after getting the state dictionary from the `safetensors.torch.save_model()` method to its own `safetensors.torch.save_state_dict()` method, and refactors the `save_model` method to just call the `save_state_dict` method instead.\r\n\r\nMotivation for this change:  make converting loaded models from `pytorch_model.bin` files to `model.safetensors` files easier. The conversion process does not need the model to be instantiated, but only needs to know which tensors have to be converted. With the current interface, we would have to use `save_file`, which does not support shared tensors. Otherwise, we would have to load the state dictionary into a model. This change allows us to skip this process and call `save_state_dict` directly. \r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-16T09:49:21Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T08:18:19Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-31T08:18:18Z",

In this case both PyTorch and Safetensors were returning 'cuda:N' by default. This is causing runtime failures if user actually runs something on non-cuda device and does not have cuda at all. Recently this was addressed on PyTorch side by [1]: starting from PyTorch 2.5 calling 'torch.device(N)' will return current device instead of cuda device.\r\n\r\nThis commit is making similar change to Safetensors. If only device index is given, Safetensors will query and return device calling 'torch.device(N)'. This change is backward compatible since this call would return 'cuda:N' on PyTorch <=2.4 which aligns with previous Safetensors behavior.\r\n\r\n[1]:
