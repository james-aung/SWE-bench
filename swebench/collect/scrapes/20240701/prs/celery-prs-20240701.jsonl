Description\r\nAdded checks for `soft_time_limit` and `time_limit`:\r\n- In `celery/app/task.py`, added a check to ensure `soft_time_limit` does not exceed `time_limit`.\r\n- In `t/integration/tasks.py`, added a wrapper function `soft_time_limit_must_exceed_time_limit` to handle `soft_time_limit` and `time_limit` settings.\r\n- In `t/integration/test_tasks.py`, added tests to verify the new logic.\r\n\r\nThese changes are necessary to prevent errors related to incorrect task time limit configurations.\r\n\r\nFixes #9125 \r\n\r\n<!-- Please describe your pull request.\r\n\r\nNOTE: All patches should be made against main, not a maintenance branch like\r\n3.1, 2.5, etc.  That is unless the bug is already fixed in main, but not in\r\nthat version

Thanks to all\nof the [contributors](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/graphs/contributors)\nthat have helped us get this far!\n\n Features\n\n- pre-commit&#x27;s cache directory has moved from `~/.pre-commit` to\n  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pre-commit` (usually `~/.cache/pre-commit`).\n    - `pre-commit clean` now cleans up both the old and new directory.\n    - If you were caching this directory in CI, you&#x27;ll want to adjust the\n      location.\n    - 562 issue by nagromc.\n    - 602 PR by asottile.\n- A new configuration format for `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is introduced which\n  will enable future development.\n    - The new format has a top-level map instead of a top-level list.  The\n      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.\n    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.\n    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to &quot;upgrade&quot;\n      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.\n    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.\n    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation\n      warning.\n    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:\n\n    diff\n    +repos:\n     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n         sha: v0.9.2\n         hooks:\n    \n    - 414 issue by asottile.\n    - 610 PR by asottile.\n\n Updating\n\n- Run `pre-commit migrate-config` to convert `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the\n  new map format.\n- Update any references from `~/.pre-commit` to `~/.cache/pre-commit`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Allow --config to affect `pre-commit install`\n- Tweak not found error message during `pre-push` / `commit-msg`\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix `--all-files`, detection of staged files, detection of manually edited\n  files during merge conflict, and detection of files to push for non-ascii\n  filenames.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Only mention locking when waiting for a lock.\n- Fix `IOError` during locking in timeout situation on windows under python 2.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a new `docker_image` language type.  `docker_image` is intended to be a\n  lightweight hook type similar to `system` / `script` which allows one to use\n  an existing docker image that provides a hook.  `docker_image` hooks can\n  also be used as repository `local` hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.17.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix typos in help\n- Allow `commit-msg` hook to be uninstalled\n- Upgrade the `sample-config`\n- Remove undocumented `--no-stash` and `--allow-unstaged-config`\n- Remove `validate_config` hook pre-commit hook.\n- Fix installation race condition when multiple `pre-commit` processes would\n  attempt to install the same repository.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- autoupdate attempts to maintain config formatting.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Initialize submodules in hook repositories.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Remove backward compatibility with repositories providing metadata via\n  `hooks.yaml`.

Thanks to all\nof the [contributors](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/graphs/contributors)\nthat have helped us get this far!\n\n Features\n\n- pre-commit&#x27;s cache directory has moved from `~/.pre-commit` to\n  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pre-commit` (usually `~/.cache/pre-commit`).\n    - `pre-commit clean` now cleans up both the old and new directory.\n    - If you were caching this directory in CI, you&#x27;ll want to adjust the\n      location.\n    - 562 issue by nagromc.\n    - 602 PR by asottile.\n- A new configuration format for `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is introduced which\n  will enable future development.\n    - The new format has a top-level map instead of a top-level list.  The\n      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.\n    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.\n    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to &quot;upgrade&quot;\n      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.\n    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.\n    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation\n      warning.\n    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:\n\n    diff\n    +repos:\n     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n         sha: v0.9.2\n         hooks:\n    \n    - 414 issue by asottile.\n    - 610 PR by asottile.\n\n Updating\n\n- Run `pre-commit migrate-config` to convert `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the\n  new map format.\n- Update any references from `~/.pre-commit` to `~/.cache/pre-commit`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Allow --config to affect `pre-commit install`\n- Tweak not found error message during `pre-push` / `commit-msg`\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix `--all-files`, detection of staged files, detection of manually edited\n  files during merge conflict, and detection of files to push for non-ascii\n  filenames.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Only mention locking when waiting for a lock.\n- Fix `IOError` during locking in timeout situation on windows under python 2.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a new `docker_image` language type.  `docker_image` is intended to be a\n  lightweight hook type similar to `system` / `script` which allows one to use\n  an existing docker image that provides a hook.  `docker_image` hooks can\n  also be used as repository `local` hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.17.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix typos in help\n- Allow `commit-msg` hook to be uninstalled\n- Upgrade the `sample-config`\n- Remove undocumented `--no-stash` and `--allow-unstaged-config`\n- Remove `validate_config` hook pre-commit hook.\n- Fix installation race condition when multiple `pre-commit` processes would\n  attempt to install the same repository.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- autoupdate attempts to maintain config formatting.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Initialize submodules in hook repositories.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Remove backward compatibility with repositories providing metadata via\n  `hooks.yaml`.

Thanks to all\nof the [contributors](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/graphs/contributors)\nthat have helped us get this far!\n\n Features\n\n- pre-commit&#x27;s cache directory has moved from `~/.pre-commit` to\n  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pre-commit` (usually `~/.cache/pre-commit`).\n    - `pre-commit clean` now cleans up both the old and new directory.\n    - If you were caching this directory in CI, you&#x27;ll want to adjust the\n      location.\n    - 562 issue by nagromc.\n    - 602 PR by asottile.\n- A new configuration format for `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is introduced which\n  will enable future development.\n    - The new format has a top-level map instead of a top-level list.  The\n      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.\n    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.\n    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to &quot;upgrade&quot;\n      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.\n    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.\n    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation\n      warning.\n    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:\n\n    diff\n    +repos:\n     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n         sha: v0.9.2\n         hooks:\n    \n    - 414 issue by asottile.\n    - 610 PR by asottile.\n\n Updating\n\n- Run `pre-commit migrate-config` to convert `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the\n  new map format.\n- Update any references from `~/.pre-commit` to `~/.cache/pre-commit`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Allow --config to affect `pre-commit install`\n- Tweak not found error message during `pre-push` / `commit-msg`\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix `--all-files`, detection of staged files, detection of manually edited\n  files during merge conflict, and detection of files to push for non-ascii\n  filenames.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Only mention locking when waiting for a lock.\n- Fix `IOError` during locking in timeout situation on windows under python 2.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a new `docker_image` language type.  `docker_image` is intended to be a\n  lightweight hook type similar to `system` / `script` which allows one to use\n  an existing docker image that provides a hook.  `docker_image` hooks can\n  also be used as repository `local` hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.17.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix typos in help\n- Allow `commit-msg` hook to be uninstalled\n- Upgrade the `sample-config`\n- Remove undocumented `--no-stash` and `--allow-unstaged-config`\n- Remove `validate_config` hook pre-commit hook.\n- Fix installation race condition when multiple `pre-commit` processes would\n  attempt to install the same repository.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- autoupdate attempts to maintain config formatting.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Initialize submodules in hook repositories.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Remove backward compatibility with repositories providing metadata via\n  `hooks.yaml`.

The\n      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.\n    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.\n    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to &quot;upgrade&quot;\n      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.\n    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.\n    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation\n      warning.\n    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:\n\n    diff\n    +repos:\n     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n         sha: v0.9.2\n         hooks:\n    \n    - 414 issue by asottile.\n    - 610 PR by asottile.\n\n Updating\n\n- Run `pre-commit migrate-config` to convert `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the\n  new map format.\n- Update any references from `~/.pre-commit` to `~/.cache/pre-commit`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Allow --config to affect `pre-commit install`\n- Tweak not found error message during `pre-push` / `commit-msg`\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix `--all-files`, detection of staged files, detection of manually edited\n  files during merge conflict, and detection of files to push for non-ascii\n  filenames.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Only mention locking when waiting for a lock.\n- Fix `IOError` during locking in timeout situation on windows under python 2.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a new `docker_image` language type.  `docker_image` is intended to be a\n  lightweight hook type similar to `system` / `script` which allows one to use\n  an existing docker image that provides a hook.  `docker_image` hooks can\n  also be used as repository `local` hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.17.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix typos in help\n- Allow `commit-msg` hook to be uninstalled\n- Upgrade the `sample-config`\n- Remove undocumented `--no-stash` and `--allow-unstaged-config`\n- Remove `validate_config` hook pre-commit hook.\n- Fix installation race condition when multiple `pre-commit` processes would\n  attempt to install the same repository.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- autoupdate attempts to maintain config formatting.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Initialize submodules in hook repositories.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Remove backward compatibility with repositories providing metadata via\n  `hooks.yaml`.

These options take\n  an array of &quot;tags&quot; identified for each file.  The tags are sourced from\n  [identify](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify).  One can list the tags\n  for a file by running `identify-cli filename`.\n- `files` is now optional (defaulting to `&#x27;&#x27;`)\n- `always_run` + missing `files` also defaults to `files: &#x27;&#x27;` (previously it\n  defaulted to `&#x27;^$&#x27;` (this reverses e150921c).\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Expose `--origin` and `--source` as `PRE_COMMIT_ORIGIN` and\n  `PRE_COMMIT_SOURCE` environment variables when running as `pre-push`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Use `--no-ext-diff` when running `git diff`\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Don&#x27;t crash when `always_run` is `True` and `files` is not provided.\n- Set `VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD` when making python virtualenvs.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a `pre-commit sample-config` command\n- Enable ansi color escapes on modern windows\n- `autoupdate` now defaults to `--tags-only`, use `--bleeding-edge` for the\n  old behavior\n- Add support for `log_file` in hook configuration to tee hook output to a\n  file for CI consumption, etc.\n- Fix crash with unicode commit messages during merges in python 2.\n- Add a `pass_filenames` option to allow disabling automatic filename\n  positional arguments to hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.6\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix regression in 0.13.5: allow `always_run` and `files` together despite\n  doing nothing.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.5\n   ```\n   ===================\n- 0.13.4 contained incorrect files\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.4\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add `--show-diff-on-failure` option to `pre-commit run`\n- Replace `jsonschema` with better error messages\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add `--allow-missing-config` to install: allows `git commit` without a\n  configuration.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Version the local hooks repo\n- Allow `minimum_pre_commit_version` for local hooks\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix placeholder gem for ruby local hooks\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Autoupdate now works even when the current state is broken.\n- Improve pre-push fileset on new branches\n- Allow &quot;language local&quot; hooks, hooks which install dependencies using\n  `additional_dependencies` and `language` are now allowed in `repo: local`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix docker hooks on older (&lt;1.12) docker\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- golang hooks now support additional_dependencies\n- Added a --tags-only option to pre-commit autoupdate\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- The new default file for implementing hooks in remote repositories is now\n  .pre-commit-hooks.yaml to encourage repositories to add the metadata.

The\n      new format puts the hook repositories in a `repos` key.\n    - Old list-based configurations will continue to be supported.\n    - A command `pre-commit migrate-config` has been introduced to &quot;upgrade&quot;\n      the configuration format to the new map-based configuration.\n    - `pre-commit autoupdate` now automatically calls `migrate-config`.\n    - In a later release, list-based configurations will issue a deprecation\n      warning.\n    - An example diff for upgrading a configuration:\n\n    diff\n    +repos:\n     -   repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks\n         sha: v0.9.2\n         hooks:\n    \n    - 414 issue by asottile.\n    - 610 PR by asottile.\n\n Updating\n\n- Run `pre-commit migrate-config` to convert `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the\n  new map format.\n- Update any references from `~/.pre-commit` to `~/.cache/pre-commit`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Allow --config to affect `pre-commit install`\n- Tweak not found error message during `pre-push` / `commit-msg`\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix `--all-files`, detection of staged files, detection of manually edited\n  files during merge conflict, and detection of files to push for non-ascii\n  filenames.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Only mention locking when waiting for a lock.\n- Fix `IOError` during locking in timeout situation on windows under python 2.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.18.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a new `docker_image` language type.  `docker_image` is intended to be a\n  lightweight hook type similar to `system` / `script` which allows one to use\n  an existing docker image that provides a hook.  `docker_image` hooks can\n  also be used as repository `local` hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.17.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix typos in help\n- Allow `commit-msg` hook to be uninstalled\n- Upgrade the `sample-config`\n- Remove undocumented `--no-stash` and `--allow-unstaged-config`\n- Remove `validate_config` hook pre-commit hook.\n- Fix installation race condition when multiple `pre-commit` processes would\n  attempt to install the same repository.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- autoupdate attempts to maintain config formatting.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Initialize submodules in hook repositories.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Improve node support when running under cygwin.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.16.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Remove backward compatibility with repositories providing metadata via\n  `hooks.yaml`.

These options take\n  an array of &quot;tags&quot; identified for each file.  The tags are sourced from\n  [identify](https://github.com/chriskuehl/identify).  One can list the tags\n  for a file by running `identify-cli filename`.\n- `files` is now optional (defaulting to `&#x27;&#x27;`)\n- `always_run` + missing `files` also defaults to `files: &#x27;&#x27;` (previously it\n  defaulted to `&#x27;^$&#x27;` (this reverses e150921c).\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Expose `--origin` and `--source` as `PRE_COMMIT_ORIGIN` and\n  `PRE_COMMIT_SOURCE` environment variables when running as `pre-push`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Use `--no-ext-diff` when running `git diff`\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Don&#x27;t crash when `always_run` is `True` and `files` is not provided.\n- Set `VIRTUALENV_NO_DOWNLOAD` when making python virtualenvs.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.14.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add a `pre-commit sample-config` command\n- Enable ansi color escapes on modern windows\n- `autoupdate` now defaults to `--tags-only`, use `--bleeding-edge` for the\n  old behavior\n- Add support for `log_file` in hook configuration to tee hook output to a\n  file for CI consumption, etc.\n- Fix crash with unicode commit messages during merges in python 2.\n- Add a `pass_filenames` option to allow disabling automatic filename\n  positional arguments to hooks.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.6\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix regression in 0.13.5: allow `always_run` and `files` together despite\n  doing nothing.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.5\n   ```\n   ===================\n- 0.13.4 contained incorrect files\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.4\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add `--show-diff-on-failure` option to `pre-commit run`\n- Replace `jsonschema` with better error messages\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.3\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Add `--allow-missing-config` to install: allows `git commit` without a\n  configuration.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Version the local hooks repo\n- Allow `minimum_pre_commit_version` for local hooks\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix placeholder gem for ruby local hooks\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.13.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Autoupdate now works even when the current state is broken.\n- Improve pre-push fileset on new branches\n- Allow &quot;language local&quot; hooks, hooks which install dependencies using\n  `additional_dependencies` and `language` are now allowed in `repo: local`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.2\n   ```\n   ===================\n- Fix docker hooks on older (&lt;1.12) docker\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.1\n   ```\n   ===================\n- golang hooks now support additional_dependencies\n- Added a --tags-only option to pre-commit autoupdate\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 0.12.0\n   ```\n   ===================\n- The new default file for implementing hooks in remote repositories is now\n  .pre-commit-hooks.yaml to encourage repositories to add the metadata.

Users on older version of OpenSSL will need to upgrade.\n* **BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE:** Dropped support for LibreSSL &lt; 3.8.\n* Updated Windows, macOS, and Linux wheels to be compiled with OpenSSL 3.3.1.\n* Updated the minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) to 1.65.0, from 1.63.0.\n* :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.generate_private_key`\n  now enforces a minimum RSA key size of 1024-bit. Note that 1024-bit is still\n  considered insecure, users should generally use a key size of 2048-bits.\n* :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.serialize_certificates`\n  now emits ASN.1 that more closely follows the recommendations in :rfc:`2315`.\n* Added new :doc:`/hazmat/decrepit/index` module which contains outdated and\n  insecure cryptographic primitives.\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.CAST5`,\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.SEED`,\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.IDEA`, and\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.Blowfish`, which were\n  deprecated in 37.0.0, have been added to this module. They will be removed\n  from the ``cipher`` module in 45.0.0.\n* Moved :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.TripleDES`\n  and :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.algorithms.ARC4` into\n  :doc:`/hazmat/decrepit/index` and deprecated them in the ``cipher`` module.\n  They will be removed from the ``cipher`` module in 48.0.0.\n* Added support for deterministic\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.ec.ECDSA` (:rfc:`6979`)\n* Added support for client certificate verification to the\n  :mod:`X.509 path validation &lt;cryptography.x509.verification&gt;` APIs in the\n  form of :class:`~cryptography.x509.verification.ClientVerifier`,\n  :class:`~cryptography.x509.verification.VerifiedClient`, and\n  ``PolicyBuilder``\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.verification.PolicyBuilder.build_client_verifier`.\n* Added Certificate\n  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.Certificate.public_key_algorithm_oid`\n  and Certificate Signing Request\n  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.CertificateSigningRequest.public_key_algorithm_oid`\n  to determine the :class:`~cryptography.hazmat._oid.PublicKeyAlgorithmOID`\n  Object Identifier of the public key found inside the certificate.\n* Added :attr:`~cryptography.x509.InvalidityDate.invalidity_date_utc`, a\n  timezone-aware alternative to the na\u00efve ``datetime`` attribute\n  :attr:`~cryptography.x509.InvalidityDate.invalidity_date`.\n* Added support for parsing empty DN string in\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.Name.from_rfc4514_string`.\n* Added the following properties that return timezone-aware ``datetime`` objects:\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.produced_at_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.revocation_time_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.this_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPResponse.next_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPSingleResponse.revocation_time_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPSingleResponse.this_update_utc`,\n  :meth:`~cryptography.x509.ocsp.OCSPSingleResponse.next_update_utc`,\n  These are timezone-aware variants of existing properties that return na\u00efve\n  ``datetime`` objects.\n* Added\n  :func:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.asymmetric.rsa.rsa_recover_private_exponent`\n* Added :meth:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers.CipherContext.reset_nonce`\n  for altering the ``nonce`` of a cipher context without initializing a new\n  instance. See the docs for additional restrictions.\n* :class:`~cryptography.x509.NameAttribute` now raises an exception when\n  attempting to create a common name whose length is shorter or longer than\n  :rfc:`5280` permits.\n* Added basic support for PKCS7 encryption (including SMIME) via\n  :class:`~cryptography.hazmat.primitives.serialization.pkcs7.PKCS7EnvelopeBuilder`.\n\n.. _v42-0-8:\n   ```\n

There are no other changes.\n   ```\n   \n  \n  \n   ### 8.3.0\n   ```\n   =========================\n\nNew features\n------------\n\n- `12231 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231&gt;`_: Added `--xfail-tb` flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.\n\n  * If the `--xfail-tb` flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.\n  * The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with `--tb`, and can be `auto|long|short|line|native|no`.\n  * Note: Even if you have `--xfail-tb` set, you won&#x27;t see them if `--tb=no`.\n\n  Some history:\n\n  With pytest 8.0, `-rx` or `-ra` would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don&#x27;t want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.\n\n  This change detaches xfail tracebacks from `-rx`, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with `--xfail-tb`. With this, the default `-rx`/ `-ra` behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.\n\n\n- `12281 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281&gt;`_: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.\n\n  Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\n  Supported values are :class:`int`, (unescaped) :class:`str`, :class:`bool` &amp; :data:`None`.\n\n  See :ref:`marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;` for more information.\n\n  -- by :user:`lovetheguitar`\n\n\n- `12567 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567&gt;`_: Added ``--no-fold-skipped`` command line option.\n\n  If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\n  by reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\n  way as other statuses.\n\n  -- by :user:`pbrezina`\n\n\n\nImprovements in existing functionality\n--------------------------------------\n\n- `12469 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469&gt;`_: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,\n  replacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\n  reference to :std:doc:`setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;`\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n\n\n- `12544 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544&gt;`_, `#12545 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545&gt;`_: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\n  checking for a :file:`pyvenv.cfg` file, ensuring reliable detection on\n  various platforms -- by :user:`zachsnickers`.\n\n\n- `2871 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2871&gt;`_: Do not truncate arguments to functions in output when running with `-vvv`.\n\n\n- `389 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/389&gt;`_: The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced\n  -- by :user:`farbodahm`, :user:`webknjaz`, :user:`obestwalter`, :user:`flub`\n  and :user:`glyphack`.\n\n  Earlier, it was like:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n      =================================== FAILURES ===================================\n      _____________________________________ test _____________________________________\n\n          def test():\n      &gt;

Regressed in 8.2.2.\n\n\n- `12472 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12472&gt;`_: Fixed a crash when returning category ``&quot;error&quot;`` or ``&quot;failed&quot;`` with a custom test status from :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook -- :user:`pbrezina`.\n\n\n- `12505 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12505&gt;`_: Improved handling of invalid regex patterns in :func:`pytest.raises(match=r&#x27;...&#x27;) &lt;pytest.raises&gt;` by providing a clear error message.\n\n\n- `12580 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12580&gt;`_: Fixed a crash when using the cache class on Windows and the cache directory was created concurrently.\n\n\n- `6962 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962&gt;`_: Parametrization parameters are now compared using `==` instead of `is` (`is` is still used as a fallback if the parameter does not support `==`).\n  This fixes use of parameters such as lists, which have a different `id` but compare equal, causing fixtures to be re-computed instead of being cached.\n\n\n- `7166 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7166&gt;`_: Fixed progress percentages (the ``[ 87%]`` at the edge of the screen) sometimes not aligning correctly when running with pytest-xdist ``-n``.\n\n\n\nImproved documentation\n----------------------\n\n- `12153 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12153&gt;`_: Documented using :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` to detect if code is running from within a pytest run.\n\n\n- `12469 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469&gt;`_: The external plugin mentions in the documentation now avoid mentioning\n  :std:doc:`setuptools entry-points &lt;setuptools:index&gt;` as the concept is\n  much more generic nowadays. Instead, the terminology of &quot;external&quot;,\n  &quot;installed&quot;, or &quot;third-party&quot; plugins (or packages) replaces that.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12577 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12577&gt;`_: `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables role is discribed in\n  the reference doc. They now also appear when doing `pytest -h`\n  -- by :user:`MarcBresson`.\n\n\n\nContributor-facing changes\n--------------------------\n\n- `12467 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12467&gt;`_: Migrated all internal type-annotations to the python3.10+ style by using the `annotations` future import.\n\n  -- by :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt`\n\n\n- `11771 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11771&gt;`_, `#12557 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12557&gt;`_: The PyPy runtime version has been updated to 3.9 from 3.8 that introduced\n  a flaky bug at the garbage collector which was not expected to fix there\n  as the 3.8 is EoL.\n\n  -- by :user:`x612skm`\n\n\n- `12493 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12493&gt;`_: The change log draft preview integration has been refactored to use a\n  third party extension ``sphinxcontib-towncrier``. The previous in-repo\n  script was putting the change log preview file at\n  :file:`doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst`. Said file is no longer\n  ignored in Git and might show up among untracked files in the\n  development environments of the contributors. To address that, the\n  contributors can run the following command that will clean it up:\n\n  .. code-block:: console\n\n     $ git clean -x -i -- doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12498 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12498&gt;`_: All the undocumented ``tox`` environments now have descriptions.\n  They can be listed in one&#x27;s development environment by invoking\n  ``tox -av`` in a terminal.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12501 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12501&gt;`_: The changelog configuration has been updated to introduce more accurate\n  audience-tailored categories. Previously, there was a ``trivial``\n  change log fragment type with an unclear and broad meaning. It was\n  removed and we now have ``contrib``, ``misc`` and ``packaging`` in\n  place of it.\n\n  The new change note types target the readers who are downstream\n  packagers and project contributors. Additionally, the miscellaneous\n  section is kept for unspecified updates that do not fit anywhere else.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12502 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12502&gt;`_: The UX of the GitHub automation making pull requests to update the\n  plugin list has been updated. Previously, the maintainers had to close\n  the automatically created pull requests and re-open them to trigger the\n  CI runs. From now on, they only need to click the `Ready for review`\n  button instead.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12522 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12522&gt;`_: The ``:pull:`` RST role has been replaced with a shorter\n  ``:pr:`` due to starting to use the implementation from\n  the third-party :pypi:`sphinx-issues` Sphinx extension\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n\n\n- `12531 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12531&gt;`_: The coverage reporting configuration has been updated to exclude\n  pytest&#x27;s own tests marked as expected to fail from the coverage\n  report. This has an effect of reducing the influence of flaky\n  tests on the resulting number.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12533 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12533&gt;`_: The ``extlinks`` Sphinx extension is no longer enabled. The ``:bpo:``\n  role it used to declare has been removed with that. BPO itself has\n  migrated to GitHub some years ago and it is possible to link the\n  respective issues by using their GitHub issue numbers and the\n  ``:issue:`` role that the ``sphinx-issues`` extension implements.\n\n  -- by :user:`webknjaz`\n\n\n- `12562 &lt;https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12562&gt;`_: Possible typos in using the ``:user:`` RST role is now being linted\n  through the pre-commit tool integration -- by :user:`webknjaz`.\n   ```\n   \n  \n</details>\n\n\n \n\n<details>\n  <summary>Links</summary>\n  \n  - PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/pytest\n  -

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:</p>\n<pre><code>python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can read the full documentation for this release on <a href=\"http://mypy.readthedocs.io\">Read the Docs</a>.</p>\n<h4>Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)</h4>\n<p>Mypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 (<a href=\"https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/\">PEP 695</a>).\nThis feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the <code>--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax</code> flag, or with <code>enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax</code> in the mypy configuration file.\nWe plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.</p>\n<p>This example demonstrates the new syntax:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code># Generic function\ndef f[T](https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n<p>reveal_type(f(1))  # Revealed type is 'int'</p>\n<h1>Generic class</h1>\n<p>class C[T]:\ndef <strong>init</strong>(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\nself.x = x</p>\n<p>c = C('a')\nreveal_type(c.x)  # Revealed type is 'str'</p>\n<h1>Type alias</h1>\n<p>type A[T] = C[list[T]]\n</code></pre></p>\n<p>This feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.</p>\n<h4>Support for <code>functools.partial</code></h4>\n<p>Mypy now type checks uses of <code>functools.partial</code>. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.</p>\n<p>This example will now produce an error:</p>\n<pre lang=\"python\"><code>from functools import partial\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt; \n</code></pre>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

Mypy is a static type checker for Python. This release includes new features, performance improvements and bug fixes. You can install it as follows:\n\n    python3 -m pip install -U mypy\n\nYou can read the full documentation for this release on [Read the Docs](http://mypy.readthedocs.io).\n\n Support Python 3.12 Syntax for Generics (PEP 695)\n\nMypy now supports the new type parameter syntax introduced in Python 3.12 ([PEP 695](https://peps.python.org/pep-0695/)).\nThis feature is still experimental and must be enabled with the `--enable-incomplete-feature=NewGenericSyntax` flag, or with `enable_incomplete_feature = NewGenericSyntax` in the mypy configuration file.\nWe plan to enable this by default in the next mypy feature release.\n\nThis example demonstrates the new syntax:\n\npython\n Generic function\ndef f[T](x: T) -&gt; T: ...\n\nreveal_type(f(1))   Revealed type is &#x27;int&#x27;\n\n Generic class\nclass C[T]:\n    def __init__(self, x: T) -&gt; None:\n       self.x = x\n\nc = C(&#x27;a&#x27;)\nreveal_type(c.x)   Revealed type is &#x27;str&#x27;\n\n Type alias\ntype A[T] = C[list[T]]\n\n\nThis feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo.\n\n\n Support for `functools.partial`\n\nMypy now type checks uses of `functools.partial`. Previously mypy would accept arbitrary arguments.\n\nThis example will now produce an error:\n\npython\nfrom functools import partial\n\ndef f(a: int, b: str) -&gt; None: ...\n\ng = partial(f, 1)\n\n Argument has incompatible type &quot;int&quot;; expected &quot;str&quot;\ng(11)\n\n\nThis feature was contributed by Shantanu (PR [16939](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/16939)).\n\n\n Stricter Checks for Untyped Overrides\n\nPast mypy versions didn&#x27;t check if untyped methods were compatible with overridden methods. This would result in false negatives. Now mypy performs these checks when using `--check-untyped-defs`.\n\nFor example, this now generates an error if using `--check-untyped-defs`:\n\npython\nclass Base:\n    def f(self, x: int = 0) -&gt; None: ...\n\nclass Derived(Base):\n     Signature incompatible with &quot;Base&quot;\n    def f(self): ...\n\n\nThis feature was contributed by Steven Troxler (PR [17276](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17276)).\n\n\n Type Inference Improvements\n\nThe new polymorphic inference algorithm introduced in mypy 1.5 is now used in more situations. This improves type inference involving generic higher-order functions, in particular.\n\nThis feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17348](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17348)).\n\nMypy now uses unions of tuple item types in certain contexts to enable more precise inferred types. Example:\n\npython\nfor x in (1, &#x27;x&#x27;):\n     Previously inferred as &#x27;object&#x27;\n    reveal_type(x)   Revealed type is &#x27;int | str&#x27;\n\n\nThis was also contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17408](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17408)).\n\n\n Improvements to Detection of Overlapping Overloads\n\nThe details of how mypy checks if two `overload` signatures are unsafely overlapping were overhauled. This both fixes some false positives, and allows mypy to detect additional unsafe signatures.\n\nThis feature was contributed by Ivan Levkivskyi (PR [17392](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17392)).\n\n\n Better Support for Type Hints in Expressions\n\nMypy now allows more expressions that evaluate to valid type annotations in all expression contexts. The inferred types of these expressions are also sometimes more precise. Previously they were often `object`.\n\nThis example uses a union type that includes a callable type as an expression, and it no longer generates an error:\n\npython\nfrom typing import Callable\n\nprint(Callable[[], int] | None)   No error\n\n\nThis feature was contributed by Jukka Lehtosalo (PR [17404](https://github.com/python/mypy/pull/17404)).\n\n\n Mypyc Improvements\n\nMypyc now supports the new syntax for generics introduced in Python 3.12 (see above). Another notable improvement is signficantly faster basic operations on `int` values.\n\n * Support Python 3.12 syntax for generic functions and classes (Jukka Lehtosalo, PR
