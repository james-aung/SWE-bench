First of all, thank you for the great project.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds type information into the API, but in an unobtrusive way.  The type descriptions only exist in the separated *.pyi* file, so that the existing code still works on Python 2 as well.  FYI it's a common way to add type information to the Python libraries supporting both 2 and 3  nowadays.\r\n\r\nI also turned `isoweek` into a package (from a module), because [PEP 561][1] requires to have an empty *py.typed* file in the package so that `pip` or other tools recognize the package has type information.  Anyway this does not break any API compatibility.\r\n\r\nThe type description can be used by several tools, like IDEs (PyCharm) and static analyzers (e.g., [Mypy]).  It would be really useful if we could check type errors like `Week('2020W06')`:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ cat t.py \r\nfrom isoweek import Week\r\nweek = Week('2020W06')\r\nprint(week.day(0), '-', week.day(1))\r\n$ mypy t.py \r\nt.py:2: error: Too few arguments for \"Week\"\r\nt.py:2: error: Argument 1 to \"Week\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"int\"\r\nFound 2 errors in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\r\n```\r\n\r\n![VS Code demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12431/74594125-2d06ba00-5076-11ea-980b-164b28144ad4.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Mypy]:
