This could lead to the subprocess' view of the lifetime of `InferenceState` contexts getting out of step with that in the parent process and resulting in errors when removing them. It is also possible that this could result in erroneous results being reported, however this was not directly observed.\r\n\r\nThe race was specifically:\r\n- `InferenceState` A created, gets id 1\r\n- `InferenceStateSubprocess` A' created, uses `InferenceState` A which it stores as a weakref and an id\r\n- `InferenceStateSubprocess` A' is used, the sub-process learns about an `InferenceState` with id 1\r\n- `InferenceState` A goes away, `InferenceStateSubprocess` A' is not yet garbage collected\r\n- `InferenceState` B created, gets id 1\r\n- `InferenceStateSubprocess` B' created, uses `InferenceState` B which it stores as a weakref and an id\r\n- `InferenceStateSubprocess` B' is used, the sub-process re-uses its entry for an `InferenceState` with id 1\r\n\r\nAt this point the order of operations between the two `InferenceStateSubprocess` instances going away is immaterial -- both will trigger a removal of a state with id 1. As long as B' doesn't try to use the sub-process again after the first removal has happened then the second removal will fail.\r\n\r\nThis change resolves the race condition by coupling the context in the subprocess to the corresponding manager class instance in the parent process, rather than to the consumer `InferenceState`.\r\n\r\nSee inline comments for further details.\r\n\r\n## Code review\r\n\r\nSuggest review by commit. There's some small refactors in the early commits. The actual fix is the last commit on the branch.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\nI'm open to ideas on how to add a test for this.\r\n\r\nCurrently this is relying on Python 3.13 tests reproducing the issue fairly easily, though not entirely consistently.\r\n\r\n### Links\r\n\r\nCurrently builds on https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi/pull/2003 (as it was discovered there), though it doesn't really need to be part of the upgrade process.", "created_at": "2024-07-01T20:17:22Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-04T21:40:27Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-04T21:39:53Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-04T21:39:53Z",
