I wanted to create separate PR for these changes as perhaps I'm not aware if something wasn't a design decision (however I have an impression that it was simply a mistake, not a design decision \ud83d\ude04 )\r\n\r\nI've updated `WebPushException.__str__` method to check if `self.response` attribute is not `None` (thus is an instance of `requests.Response`) in case of adding extra `self.response` to the string representation of `WebPushException` instance.\r\n\r\nCurrently the check was relying on checking thruthiness of `self.response` attribute. Unfortunately, this won't work properly if `requests.Response` instance has status code between 400 and 599, for which `requests.Response.__bool__` method returns `False` which in turn will fail the check and won't add extra `self.response` to the string representation of `WebPushException` instance.\r\n\r\nChecking if `self.response is not None` works properly.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass WebPushException(Exception):\r\n    \"\"\"Web Push failure.\r\n\r\n    This may contain the requests.Response\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    def __init__(self, message, response=None):\r\n        self.message = message\r\n        self.response = response\r\n\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        extra = \"\"\r\n        if self.response is not None:\r\n            try:\r\n                extra = \", Response {}\".format(\r\n                    self.response.text,\r\n                )\r\n            except AttributeError:\r\n                extra = \", Response {}\".format(self.response)\r\n        return \"WebPushException: {}{}\".format(self.message, extra)\r\n\r\nresponse = Response()\r\nresponse.status_code = 401\r\nresponse._content = \"response content\".encode()\r\nexc = WebPushException(\"message\", response)\r\nprint(exc) # WebPushException: messsage, Response response content\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you see some other places that could be changed in the scope of this PR, please let me know :smile:\r\n\r\nI've also updated the test for `WebPushException`. I've relied on using `requests.Response` instead of `Mock`, to properly reflect the behaviour of `__bool__` method (instance of `Mock` was always truthy which gave false impression that the logic works properly).\r\n\r\nOne thing I'm not quite satisfied of is using \"private\" `_content` attribute of `requests.Response` instance to set the body of faked Response, since it's a part of private interface. Some alternatives I've been thinking of are:\r\n\r\n- using some library to mock responses in tests (e.g. `responses`)\r\n- still rely on `Mock` object, however also mock `__bool__` method return value to return False for 401 status code\r\n\r\nLet me know if this needs some changes\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nSimply run\r\n\r\n```sh\r\npython -m pytest pywebpush\r\n```\r\n\r\nas the test case was updated.\r\n\r\nTesting manually:\r\n\r\n- create `WebPushException`, pass a `Response` object and check it's string representation, e.g.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nresponse = Response()\r\nresponse.status_code = 401\r\nresponse._content = \"response content\".encode()\r\nexc = WebPushException(\"message\", response)\r\nprint(exc) # WebPushException: messsage, Response response content\r\n```\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-15T08:16:16Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-19T05:06:47Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-18T17:10:02Z", "merged_at": "2024-08-18T17:10:02Z", "merge_commit_sha":
