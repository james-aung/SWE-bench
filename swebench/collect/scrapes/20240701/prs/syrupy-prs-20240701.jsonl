If the flag is active, Syrupy will attempt to import Pycharm's built-in `teamcity-messages` package (which Pycharm automatically adds to PYTHONPATH when running scripts in order to make it importable). If the import was successful, the `teamcity.diff_tools.EqualsAssertionError` object (which is responsible to calculating the string representation of the `expected` and `actual` objects in the diff view) will be patched. \r\n\r\nThe patched object will behave the same as before. However, if either the `expected` object or the `actual` objects are instances of `syrupy.assertions.SnapshotAssertion`, the `expected` and `actual` objects will be replaced by the snapshot's recalled data and asserted data respectively.\r\n\r\nNow, if we activate the new flag, the diff will be meaningful again:\r\n<img width=\"1001\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/tophat/syrupy/assets/21122724/80dc4025-2ae1-44c5-90e5-da13db006788\">\r\n\r\n\r\n## Related Issues\r\n\r\nThis PR should resolve #675 as well as the second part of #597 \r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n\r\n- [ ] This PR has sufficient documentation.\r\n- [ ] This PR has sufficient test coverage.\r\n- [X ] This PR title satisfies semantic [convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary).\r\n\r\n## Additional Comments\r\n\r\nAs you might see in the checklist, there are a few missing parts in this PR. This is because I wasn't sure how to go about certain parts of the checklist.\r\n\r\n1. At first I wanted to put the entire documentation in the README.md file (because that's where I saw the rest of the configuration going to. However, I wanted to put some images to have a more clear explanation and I wasn't sure where would be a good place to put them (if it is ok to put any at all).\r\n2. I have no idea how should I go about testing this feature considering its results are accessible via Pycharm's UI.\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2024-06-15T10:18:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-23T04:13:14Z",
