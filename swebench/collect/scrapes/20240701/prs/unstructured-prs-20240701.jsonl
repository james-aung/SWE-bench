Previously, when downloading NLTK data, a nested \"nltk_data\" directory was created within the parent \"nltk_data\" directory if the parent directory already existed. This redundant directory structure led to two significant problems:\r\n- errors in checking if data had already been downloaded, potentially causing redundant downloads in subsequent calls.\r\n- failures in loading models from the downloaded NLTK data due to incorrect path resolution.\r\n\r\nThis fix modifies the NLTK data download logic to prevent creation of unnecessary nested directories. If the download path ends with \"nltk_data\" and that directory already exists, we now use the existing directory instead of creating a new nested one.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nCI should pass.", "created_at": "2024-08-20T17:45:58Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-20T19:45:23Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-20T19:45:22Z", "merged_at": "2024-08-20T19:45:22Z", "merge_commit_sha": "01dbc7b4733e88efd6c1e85930c707009a2a966e", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3546/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3546/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/3546/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/statuses/4e0426f33b67100976a6b6666b86ab9094632212", "head": {"label": "Unstructured-IO:fix/nltk-download-path", "ref": "fix/nltk-download-path", "sha": "4e0426f33b67100976a6b6666b86ab9094632212", "user": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 541798154, "node_id": "R_kgDOIEsvCg", "name": "unstructured", "full_name": "Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "description": "Open source libraries and APIs to build custom preprocessing pipelines for labeling, training, or production machine learning pipelines.

An NLTK version bump was originally introduced in #3512 and rolled back in #3527 because `nltk==3.8.2` was yanked from PyPI, and also because we observed significant slowdowns in processing time after bumping to `nltk==3.8.2`.

The `filetype` module does a good job of this but is not perfect and does not identify MSG files.\r\n\r\nPreviously we assumed MSG format when none of DOC, PPT, or XLS was detected, but we discovered that `filetype` is not completely reliable at detecting these types.\r\n\r\nChange the behavior to remove the assumption of MSG format. `_OleFileDifferentiator` returns `None` in this case and filetype detection falls back to use filename-extension.\r\n\r\nNote a file with no filename and no metadata_filename or an incorrect extension will not be correctly identified in this case, however we're assuming for now that will be rare in practice.", "created_at": "2024-08-13T19:27:24Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-22T20:26:33Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-22T20:08:40Z", "merged_at": "2024-08-22T20:08:40Z", "merge_commit_sha": "32bb77aafb43291916e2914c756ac9930e98791b", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3516/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3516/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/3516/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/statuses/a56e627598eb2dba5de8dd9c04de66600db62a98", "head": {"label": "Unstructured-IO:scanny/no-default-OLE-subtype", "ref": "scanny/no-default-OLE-subtype", "sha": "a56e627598eb2dba5de8dd9c04de66600db62a98", "user": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 541798154, "node_id": "R_kgDOIEsvCg", "name": "unstructured", "full_name": "Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "description": "Open source libraries and APIs to build custom preprocessing pipelines for labeling, training, or production machine learning pipelines.

Text and HTML are \"synchronized\".\r\n- The table is divided at a whole-row boundary whenever possible.\r\n- A row is broken at an even-cell boundary when a single row is larger than the chunking window.\r\n- A cell is broken at an even-word boundary when a single cell is larger than the chunking window.\r\n- `.text_as_html` is \"minified\", removing all extraneous whitespace and unneeded elements or attributes.

During testing, I encountered issues with certain PDF files, such as the one attached below.\r\n[test_pdfminer_text_extraction.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16424396/test_pdfminer_text_extraction.pdf)\r\n\r\nUpon debugging, I discovered that the problem stemmed from the layout extraction phase performed by `pdfminer`. For the first page of the PDF, `pdfminer` extracted two layout objects: one containing a few words, and another categorized as an `ImageTextRegion` with a `None` text attribute. Note that the bounding box of this `ImageTextRegion` nearly matches the entire page's bounding box.\r\n\r\nThe `merge_inferred_with_extracted_layout` function compares each extracted layout with the inferred layout. Despite the deep layout recognition model accurately predicting the correct layout, the merging rules prioritize the layout objects provided by `pdfminer`. As a result, since all inferred layouts fall within the bounding box of the large ImageTextRegion, the merge rules retain the ImageTextRegion and discard the inferred layouts. This approach is generally reasonable, as `pdfminer` is typically more reliable than deep layout and OCR models.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this instance, `pdfminer` produced incorrect results. The `ImageTextRegion` contains embedded text elements, but it is classified merely as an image with no text. This issue can be attributed to the flawed design of the PDF itself. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial for our system to handle such cases more gracefully.\r\n\r\nSince I am not very familiar with the `unstructured` source code, the temporary solution I came up with is to recursively extract text from `pdfminer` objects that are identified as having no text. If no text is found, the outcome remains unchanged. However, if sub text objects are discovered within, the merge rules will prioritize retaining the pdfminer extracted results, ultimately leading to the correct outcome.\r\n\r\nHere are some extraction results for your reference.\r\n- page1_layout_pdfminer\r\n![page1_layout_pdfminer](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07f99450-e966-448a-9b40-9f54bdcd4e8f)\r\n- page1_layout_od_model\r\n![page1_layout_od_model](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab80e81e-2032-4551-868e-fa9a7d9e3968)\r\n- page1_layout_final\r\n![page1_layout_final](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e6c8d7a-3f66-47a8-a695-0f680809eee2)\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-30T08:27:37Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-01T05:58:22Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-01T05:57:05Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "2c5c2a1d15c560962559b0f6a38b8359fbb5c170", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [{"login": "christinestraub", "id": 9475974, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjk0NzU5NzQ=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9475974?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub", "html_url": "https://github.com/christinestraub", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/christinestraub/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3445/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3445/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/3445/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/statuses/470133ced5fa4c450363fe60926b1c626c296d1e", "head": {"label": "Fleandre:pdfminer/text_extraction", "ref": "pdfminer/text_extraction", "sha": "470133ced5fa4c450363fe60926b1c626c296d1e", "user": {"login": "Fleandre", "id": 56525764, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTI1NzY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56525764?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fleandre", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 833069609, "node_id": "R_kgDOMaeiKQ", "name": "unstructured", "full_name": "Fleandre/unstructured", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "Fleandre", "id": 56525764, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU2NTI1NzY0", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/56525764?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre", "html_url": "https://github.com/Fleandre", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Fleandre/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/Fleandre/unstructured", "description": "Open source libraries and APIs to build custom preprocessing pipelines for labeling, training, or production machine learning pipelines.

automatically attempt to read the csv without a separator, i think it makes sense to ignore the exception and allow pandas to do what it can to infer it instead, hence this pr.\r\n\r\nreference

However, email content sometimes contains `=\\r\\n` characters, especially when read from file-like objects such as `SpooledTemporaryFile` (the file type used in our API). This PR updates the email partitioner to remove both `=\\n` and `=\\r\\n` characters during the clearing process.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n```\r\nfilename =

This avoids unbound variable warnings and is much less noisy.\r\n\r\n`_PartitionerLoader` makes use of the new `FileType` property `.importable_package_dependencies` to determine whether all required packages are importable before dispatching the file to its partitioner. It uses `FileType.extra_name` to form a helpful error message when a dependency is not installed, so the caller knows which `pip install` extra to specify to remedy the error.\r\n\r\n`PartitionerLoader` uses the `FileType` properties `.partitioner_module_qname` and `partitioner_function_name` to load\r\nthe partitioner once its dependencies are verified.

Add methods to allow `STR_TO_FILETYPE`, `EXT_TO_FILETYPE` and `FILETYPE_TO_MIMETYPE` mappings to be replaced, removing those redundant and noisy declarations.\r\n\r\nIn the process, fix some lingering file-type identification and `.metadata.filetype` errors that had been skipped in the tests.\r\n\r\n**Additional Context**\r\nGathering the various attributes of a file-type into the `FileType` enum eliminates the duplication inherent in the separate `STR_TO_FILETYPE` etc. mappings and makes access to those values convenient for callers. These attributes include what MIME-type a file-type should record in metadata and what MIME-types and extensions map to that file-type. These values and others are made available as methods and properties directly on the `FileType` class and members. Because all attributes are defined in the `FileType` enum there is no risk of inconsistency across multiple locations and any changes happen in one and only one place. Further attributes and methods will be added in later commits to support other file-type related operations like mapping to a partitioner and verifying its dependencies are installed.", "created_at": "2024-07-17T07:18:49Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-18T02:51:07Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-18T02:51:06Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-18T02:51:06Z", "merge_commit_sha": "e99e5a8abdc8ff0fc9dadbf6c9c28ef21fdd8e3d", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3411/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3411/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/3411/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/statuses/d17184e4ae47e575498863e506e3e52745d78788", "head": {"label": "Unstructured-IO:scanny/file-type-descriptor", "ref": "scanny/file-type-descriptor", "sha": "d17184e4ae47e575498863e506e3e52745d78788", "user": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 541798154, "node_id": "R_kgDOIEsvCg", "name": "unstructured", "full_name": "Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "Unstructured-IO", "id": 108372208, "node_id": "O_kgDOBnWg8A", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/108372208?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO", "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/Unstructured-IO/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/Unstructured-IO/unstructured", "description": "Open source libraries and APIs to build custom preprocessing pipelines for labeling, training, or production machine learning pipelines.

for all image example files\r\n- Moved relevant PDF files from `example-docs/` to `example-docs/pdf/`\r\n- Moved relevant image files from `example-docs/` to `example-docs/img/`\r\n- Updated file paths in affected unit & ingest tests to reflect the new directory structure\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\nAll unit & ingest tests should be updated and verified to work with the new file structure.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOther file types (e.g., office documents, HTML files) remain in the root of `example-docs/` for now.\r\n\r\n## Next Steps\r\nConsider similar reorganization for other file types if this

Removes `nltk.download` in favor of a `.tgz` file with the appropriate NLTK data files and checking the SHA256 hash to validate the download. An error now raises if `nltk.download` is invoked.\r\n\r\nThe logic for determining the NLTK download directory is borrowed from `nltk`, so users can still set `NLTK_DATA` as they did previously.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n1. Create a directory called `~/tmp/nltk_test`. Set `NLTK_DATA=${HOME}/tmp/nltk_test`.\r\n2. From a python interactive session, run:\r\n```python\r\nfrom unstructured.nlp.tokenize import download_nltk_packages\r\n\r\ndownload_nltk_packages()\r\n```\r\n3. Run `ls /tmp/nltk_test/nltk_data`.

We would love to partner up and contribute to this project.  @MthwRobinson ", "created_at": "2024-07-03T09:22:48Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-26T14:35:11Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-26T14:35:11Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "545e1c417ec2285096bcef72318fac3bd92a681e", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3347/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/3347/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/issues/3347/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/Unstructured-IO/unstructured/statuses/c554ba5a66aade4a1d04b2f338e4484e544a44b0", "head": {"label": "mixedbread-ai:rui/mixedbread-ai-integration", "ref": "rui/mixedbread-ai-integration", "sha": "c554ba5a66aade4a1d04b2f338e4484e544a44b0", "user": {"login": "mixedbread-ai", "id": 153227975, "node_id": "O_kgDOCSISxw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153227975?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai", "html_url": "https://github.com/mixedbread-ai", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 818642424, "node_id": "R_kgDOMMt9-A", "name": "unstructured", "full_name": "mixedbread-ai/unstructured", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "mixedbread-ai", "id": 153227975, "node_id": "O_kgDOCSISxw", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/153227975?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai", "html_url": "https://github.com/mixedbread-ai", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/mixedbread-ai/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/mixedbread-ai/unstructured", "description": "Open source libraries and APIs to build custom preprocessing pipelines for labeling, training, or production machine learning pipelines.

subcases:\r\n- table was predicted by OD as two sub tables (so half in two, there are two non overlapping subtables) -> in my opinion both are correct\r\n- it is false positive from tables matching
