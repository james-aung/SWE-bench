The Python object was disowned when the temporary `unique_ptr<T, D>` was built. This was unintentional and counter-intuitive (although bug-compatible with [PyCLIF](http://github.com/google/clif); probably also unintentional).\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a different mechanism, specifically for `const unique_ptr<T, D> &`: a temporary (still non-const) `unique_ptr<T, D>` is built, but the Python object is **not** disowned, and the temporary `unique_ptr` is meant to never expire (this would only be possible if the passed-to C++ code applied a `const_cast`, to then disown the non-const `unique_ptr`). When the `type_caster` goes out of scope, the new implementation checks if the temporary `unique_ptr` did in fact not expire (otherwise a `FATAL` exception is thrown), then `.release()`s it before deleting the `unique_ptr` object. Conveniently, this can be achieved by managing the temporary `unique_ptr` with a `shared_ptr` and a custom deleter.\r\n\r\nI (rwgk) strongly considered the alternative of using a `static_assert()` to make it impossible to pass a Python object as a `const unique_ptr<T, D> &`, but the new implementation is sufficiently small, it's less trouble than backing out all existing test code that would break. There could also be existing client code in the wild that may need workarounds. Having the revised feature is convenient and not very costly (amount of code; complexity).\r\n\r\n@rhaschke FYI\r\n\r\n<!-- Include relevant issues or PRs here, describe what changed and why -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested changelog entry:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the below block with the expected RestructuredText entry.

This style of include is really designed to allow local files in the same directory (like `.inl` files) to be injected into the current location. `<>` includes are designed for headers. It's currently working in most cases due to implementation details.\r\n\r\nThis is currently broken, however, if you use a long path prefix on Windows (`\\\\?\\`). For example, if you pass the include as `/I:system \\\\?\\C:\\pybind11\\include`, then the compiler constructs the path as `\\\\?\\C:\\pybind11\\include\\pybind11\\detail\\../thing.h` - but that's invalid, as `..` is not processed as a \"up one\" in a Windows long path, but as a directory named `..`. Long paths are being used in specific situations (https://github.com/pypa/cibuildwheel/issues/1975), breaking pybind11 usage.\r\n\r\nThis is the minimum to fix that. Ideally, files should never include something from a parent folder, and (at least) public includes should be included via the public include path, but this is the minimum to fix pybind11 for MSVC.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nTitle (above): please place [branch_name] at the beginning if you are targeting a branch other than master. *Do not target stable*.\r\nIt is recommended to use conventional commit format, see conventionalcommits.org, but not required.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Include relevant issues or PRs here, describe what changed and why -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested changelog entry:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the below block with the expected RestructuredText entry.

(which always requires `semiregular`), so it's necessary to add a default constructor for `iterator_policies` classes.\r\n\r\nMoreover, [`forward_iterator` concept](http://eel.is/c++draft/iterator.concept.forward#2) requires that:\r\n> Value-initialized iterators of the same type may be compared and shall compare equal to other value-initialized iterators of the same type.\r\n\r\nand it's tested here:\r\nhttps://github.com/ObeliskGate/pybind11/blob/74615a04105366647261da83f2980cd5df01b3cd/tests/test_pytypes.cpp#L932-L940\r\n, together with

See PR #5213 Description for details.\r\n\r\nHigh-level trade-off:\r\n\r\n* `smart_holder_type_casters` (smart_holder branch before this PR) were an add-on and the `PYBIND11_INTERNALS_VERSION` did not have to be changed.\r\n\r\n* For the baked-in `smart_holder` support (smart_holder branch after this PR), the `PYBIND11_INTERNALS_VERSION` needs to be changed, but there is far fewer duplicated code.\r\n\r\nMajor benefit: The `PYBIND11_SMART_HOLDER_TYPE_CASTERS` macro is obsolete (it still exists for backward compatibility but is a no-op).\r\n\r\nAdded benefit: Testing with smart_holder as the default holder is far less important. Testing with smart_holder as the default holder will be cut back (in a follow-on PR) to one each for Linux, macOS, Windows.\r\n\r\n**NOTE:** The baked-in smart_holder functionality can easily be disabled by overriding the `PYBIND11_INTERNALS_VERSION`: setting it to `5` (or even `4`) almost completely `#ifdef`s out all code added in this PR.\r\n\r\nWork for follow-on PRs: Resolve all `SMART_HOLDER_BAKEIN_FOLLOW_ON`. This work is intentionally deferred because it will change existing code on the master branch in non-trivial ways.\r\n\r\n**Suggested order for code review:** ([internal CL](http://cl/655231400))\r\n\r\n* include/pybind11/detail/internals.h \u2014 NEW `enum class holder_enum_t`.\r\n* include/pybind11/cast.h \u2014 NEW `copyable_holder_caster` and `move_only_holder_caster` specializations for `std::shared_ptr` and `std::unique_ptr`.\r\n* include/pybind11/detail/type_caster_base.h \u2014 `smart_holder_from_unique_ptr` and `smart_holder_from_shared_ptr` implementations (based on code originally in smart_holder_type_casters.h).\r\n* include/pybind11/pybind11.h \u2014 NEW `init_instance()` specialization (based on code originally in smart_holder_type_casters.h) and modified `property_cpp_function` specializations.\r\n* Everything else under include/pybind11.\r\n\r\nBefore reviewing the test changes, please read the description of PR #5213. Most importantly, almost all changes to tests on the master branch are undone. The test_class_sh_*.cpp,py changes in this PR are essentially pure boilerplate changes or trivial.\r\n\r\n<!-- Include relevant issues or PRs here, describe what changed and why -->\r\n\r\n\r\n## Suggested changelog entry:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the below block with the expected RestructuredText entry.

The test is failing on mac and windows, however it shouldn't. It appears that on windows and mac the child process's name is not updated and a new instance of the parent process is created as a child. The child processes (at least on mac) are created with arguments similar to:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nbuild/tests/test_embed/test_embed -c from multiprocessing.spawn import spawn_main;
