This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.</p>\n<p>This change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281\">#12281</a>: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.</p>\n<p>Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\nSupported values are <code>int</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, (unescaped) <code>str</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, <code>bool</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} &amp; <code>None</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>lovetheguitar</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567\">#12567</a>: Added <code>--no-fold-skipped</code> command line option.</p>\n<p>If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\nby reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\nway as other statuses.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>pbrezina</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.</p>\n<h2>8.3.0</h2>\n<h1>pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)</h1>\n<h2>New features</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231\">#12231</a>: Added [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If the [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.</li>\n<li>The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with [--tb]{.title-ref}, and can be [auto|long|short|line|native|no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n<li>Note: Even if you have [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref} set, you won't see them if [--tb=no]{.title-ref}.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Some history:</p>\n<p>With pytest 8.0, [-rx]{.title-ref} or [-ra]{.title-ref} would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.</p>\n<p>This change detaches xfail tracebacks from [-rx]{.title-ref}, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with [--xfail-tb]{.title-ref}. With this, the default [-rx]{.title-ref}/ [-ra]{.title-ref} behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281\">#12281</a>: Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.</p>\n<p>Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments.\nSupported values are <code>int</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, (unescaped) <code>str</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;}, <code>bool</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;class&quot;} &amp; <code>None</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;data&quot;}.</p>\n<p>See <code>marker examples &lt;marker_keyword_expression_example&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;ref&quot;} for more information.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>lovetheguitar</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567\">#12567</a>: Added <code>--no-fold-skipped</code> command line option.</p>\n<p>If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped\nby reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same\nway as other statuses.</p>\n<p>-- by <code>pbrezina</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Improvements in existing functionality</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469\">#12469</a>: The console output now uses the &quot;third-party plugins&quot; terminology,\nreplacing the previously established but confusing and outdated\nreference to <code>setuptools &lt;setuptools:index&gt;</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;std:doc&quot;}\n-- by <code>webknjaz</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544\">#12544</a>, <a href=\"https://redirect.github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545\">#12545</a>: Python virtual environment detection was improved by\nchecking for a <code>pyvenv.cfg</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;file&quot;} file, ensuring reliable detection on\nvarious platforms -- by <code>zachsnickers</code>{.interpreted-text role=&quot;user&quot;}.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n</blockquote>\n<p>...

OpenGL implementation of `PColorMeshItem` uses GLSL 1.40 if the OpenGL version is detected to be >= 3.1, otherwise it falls back to shaders that are compatible with both OpenGL 2.0 and OpenGL ES 2.0.\r\n\r\nThis would fail on a system with OpenGL ES >= 3.1, as the GLSL 1.40 shaders are not compatible. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes the flat shaders compatible with OpenGL ES >= 3.0.\r\n\r\nHowever, I don't have a system with OpenGL ES 3.0 *and* a Qt compiled against OpenGL ES to actually test it out.\r\n(A Raspberry Pi 4 running 32-bit Raspberry Pi OS would be such a candidate system)\r\n\r\nA

(i.e. just redrawing the rendered `QPicture` is slow)\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of the recent OpenGL code updates to `PlotCurveItem`, we can make `PColorMeshItem` usable by rendering using OpenGL.\r\n\r\nAn example to demonstrate the speed.\r\nWe can use the peegee icons of various sizes to test out the performance.\r\nOn my laptop, `peegee_256px.png` without OpenGL gets a dismal 5 fps; whereas with OpenGL, `peegee_512@2x.png` hits 30 fps. i.e. an improvement of (1024/256)**2 * 30/5 == 96x\r\n```python\r\nimport sys\r\n\r\nimport numpy as np\r\n\r\nimport pyqtgraph as pg\r\nfrom pyqtgraph.Qt import QtCore, QtGui\r\nfrom pyqtgraph.examples.utils import FrameCounter\r\n\r\nqimage = QtGui.QImage(sys.argv[1])\r\nqimage.convertTo(QtGui.QImage.Format.Format_Grayscale8)\r\nz = pg.functions.ndarray_from_qimage(qimage)\r\n\r\n\r\nZ = z\r\nny, nx = z.shape\r\nx = np.linspace(0, nx, nx+1, endpoint=True)\r\ny = np.linspace(0, ny, ny+1, endpoint=True)\r\nX, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)\r\nX += (ny * 0.025) * np.sin(2*np.pi*2*np.linspace(0, 1, ny+1))[:, np.newaxis]\r\nY += (nx * 0.025) * np.sin(2*np.pi*2*np.linspace(0, 1, nx+1))\r\n\r\npg.setConfigOptions(useOpenGL=True, enableExperimental=True)\r\n\r\npg.mkQApp()\r\nwin = pg.PlotWidget()\r\nwin.invertY(True)\r\ncmap = pg.colormap.ColorMap(None, [0.0, 1.0])\r\npcmi = pg.PColorMeshItem(X, Y, Z, colorMap=cmap)\r\nwin.addItem(pcmi)\r\nwin.setTitle('')\r\nwin.show()\r\n\r\ncnt = 0\r\ndef update():\r\n    global cnt\r\n    cnt = (cnt + 1) % z.shape[1]\r\n    Z = np.roll(z, cnt, axis=1)\r\n    pcmi.setData(None, None, Z)\r\n    framecnt.update()\r\n\r\ntimer = QtCore.QTimer()\r\ntimer.timeout.connect(update)\r\ntimer.start()\r\n\r\nframecnt = FrameCounter()\r\nframecnt.sigFpsUpdate.connect(lambda fps: win.setTitle(f'{fps:.1f} fps'))\r\n\r\npg.exec()\r\n```\r\n\r\nAn addition to the `PColorMeshItem` API. A use-case that I have is that the mesh (XY) is fixed and only the Z values are varying. I have overloaded the `setData(None, None, Z)` to mean that the existing X, Y should be re-used. This allows to not waste time uploading vertices that have not changed.\r\n(The converse also works: `setData(X, Y, None)` means that Z should be re-used; although I don't have such a use-case)\r\n\r\nOne wart is that on termination, the following error message is shown:\r\n```\r\nQOpenGLTexturePrivate::destroy() called without a current context.\r\nTexture has not been destroyed\r\n```\r\nThis message doesn't show up on a pure `QOpenGLWidget` implementation.
