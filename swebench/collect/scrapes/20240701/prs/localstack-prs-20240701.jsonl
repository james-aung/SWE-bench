Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n- The Step Functions' SQS provider did not fully support the `MessageAttributes` field during a `SendMessage` since the initial implementation used the incorrect field name provided by the AWS docs. \r\n- This PR fixes the fieldname and adds a parity test to ensure a `MessageAttributes` JSON object and `Md5OfMessageAttributes` hash is correctly returned.\r\n- Raised by https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/11109\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Renames `\"MessageAttribute\" => \"MessageAttributes\"`\r\n- Normalises field `\"MD5OfMessageAttributes\" => \"Md5OfMessageAttributes\"` to ensure PascalCase for SFN output\r\n- Add new stepfunction template for SQS message with attributes\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- New parity test `test_send_message_attributes`\r\n- Manually validated the original issue input now passes following these changes https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/11109\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-22T10:47:24Z", "updated_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported in #11389, we did not copy the source object tags when the `TaggingDirective` was set to `COPY` or nothing, which default to `COPY`. \r\n\r\nThis was due to a small oversight, we were using the parsed version id to create the tag key, but if you don't specify a version id, you get the current object (top of the stack, the one that was last added). Instead of using the parsed version id, we now use the source object version id directly. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- use the source object version id to create the object unique key for the tags\r\n- add a new test regarding versioned bucket and tagging directive to confirm the change: it first copy an object without specifying the version id (to get the current one), then does the same against a specific version id which isn't current\r\n\r\n_fixes #11389_\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement behavior in PutObject: use the lock to be sure only the first write to succeed and block others, making them raise an exception once they acquire the lock if the object exists\r\n- implement behavior in CompleteMultipartObject: from the documentation it seems that if an object exists when completing you should raise a Precondition error, and if something existed before but got deleted, you need to raise a Conflict. Did that by attaching the original existence when creating, and checking again when completing\r\n- patch the specs for the new exceptions\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes?

`1.35`, and so did the `boto3-stubs`.\r\nIt turns out that the upgrade of the exact pin of `boto3-stubs` breaks the ASF update because:\r\n- `boto3-stubs` is explicitly set to `1.35.2` (the latest version as of today):\r\n  https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/c3cd60f70b49ce0486ca9c9b8b3d7bd270cf61c3/.github/workflows/asf-updates.yml#L79\r\n- Afterwards, we explicitly upgrade the package version in the `requirements-typehint.txt`:\r\n  https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/c3cd60f70b49ce0486ca9c9b8b3d7bd270cf61c3/.github/workflows/asf-updates.yml#L87C97-L87C106\r\n-

because these package versions have conflicting dependencies.\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nThis is because `boto3-stubs` has transitive dependencies on the minor versions (f.e. `mypy-boto3-s3`), which was bumped from `>=1.34,<1.5` to `>=1.35,<1.36`.\r\nThis ends in a conflict, because we do not explicitly list every single transitive dependency of `boto3-stubs` in the upgrade command, and these transitive dependencies are then conflicting.\r\nUnfortunately, `pip-compile` does not support any wildcards or transitive package upgrades (without upgrading _everything_), which is why this PR actually removes the pin completely.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Removes the pin on `boto3-stubs` in the `pyproject.toml`.\r\n- Upgrades the pins of `boto3`, `botocore` in the `pyproject.toml`.\r\n- Upgrades all `requirements-*.txt` dependency lock files.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Triggered an ASF update workflow run from this branch: https://github.com/localstack/localstack/actions/runs/10489221940\r\n  - The run was successful and created this PR (which was closed because it has the wrong base): https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11395", "created_at": "2024-08-21T11:40:56Z", "updated_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nWhen using `TEST_CONTAINER_MOUNT_SOURCES`, this includes mounting dependencies as well as the sources, which may not be what we want.\n\nSpecifically when the host OS is different to the container OS (e.g. macOS host, Linux container) and dependences include compiled code, the container fails to start.\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n\nAdd a new flag to choose whether we mount dependencies into the container compared to the sources.\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n-->\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nHandle the case where setting a `RedrivePolicy` attribute to an empty string removes the `RedrivePolicy` from an SQS queue's attribute map. This should be identical to how LocalStack handles an empty `Policy` attribute.\r\n\r\nCurrently, this behavior is causing Terraform deletions to initially fail. Terraform attempts to remove a queue's `aws_sqs_queue_redrive_policy` resource by setting the `RedrivePolicy` attribute value to an empty string. However, LocalStack was not removing this empty value, leading to the failure.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Setting an SQS queue's `RedrivePolicy` to an empty string now deletes it from the internal `QueueAttributeMap`\r\n- Added a test for this case at `TestSqsProvider::test_set_empty_redrive_policy`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Validated with Terraform & CLI against LocalStack and AWS\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-20T14:48:53Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-20T16:57:37Z", "closed_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n- Workaround for issue encountered when compiling `amazon-ion==0.9.3` dependency using `gcc/cmake`.\r\n- Updates to the C compiler now interpret some warnings as errors, so the dependency wheel will fail to build. In addition, there is no Mac OSX ARM64 build wheel available for this version on PyPi.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added changes to `CONTRIBUTING.md` with workaround steps. \r\n- A user can either suppress the C warnings/errors OR remove `cmake` from their `PATH` variable causing pip to build the wheel using pure Python instead of C.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-19T13:34:52Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-20T09:44:32Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-20T09:14:25Z", "merged_at": null, "merge_commit_sha": "7eae8b1af6154b64c642043d6acf5967bcbc32f0", "assignee": {"login": "gregfurman", "id": 31275503, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjc1NTAz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31275503?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman", "html_url": "https://github.com/gregfurman", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}, "assignees": [{"login": "gregfurman", "id": 31275503, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjMxMjc1NTAz", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/31275503?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman", "html_url": "https://github.com/gregfurman", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/gregfurman/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_reviewers": [{"login": "thrau", "id": 3996682, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjM5OTY2ODI=", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3996682?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau", "html_url": "https://github.com/thrau", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/thrau/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 571606119, "node_id": "MDU6TGFiZWw1NzE2MDYxMTk=", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/area:%20documentation", "name": "area: documentation", "color": "4D29B4", "default": false, "description": "Issues related to LocalStack documentation"}, {"id": 5361521728, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JUQA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20patch", "name": "semver: patch", "color": "2ECC71", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in patch releases"}], "milestone": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/milestones/3", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack/milestone/3", "labels_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/milestones/3/labels", "id": 9643023, "node_id": "MI_kwDOBEnY0s4AkyQP", "number": 3, "title": "Playground", "description": "Not sure if it will ever make it into a release?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAs discussed with @bentsku, we are changing the structure of internals and actives deployment dict in the store. This will facilitate access to the resources when only the api id is known. Notably when entirely deleting a rest api.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nAlso fixed in this PR. When deleting a rest api, we were not deleting it's deployment from the store, leading to memory leaks.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nCurrent validation checks for Lambda function names did not account for some invalid regex combinations as well as length limits for `FunctionName` differing between request types. This will add tests ensuring a wider range of invalid `FunctionName` and `Qualfier` combinations are caught.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\nThe Lambda Provider:\r\n- Remove validation checks from `create_function` in favour of `api_utils.get_name_and_qualifier`\r\n- Use improved qualifier validation and better account for invalid qualifier edge-case for `DeleteFunction`\r\n\r\nThe API utils `api_utils.py`:\r\n- Conduct name validations in the `get_name_and_qualifier` -- which is ubiquitously used across the Lambda provider and should enact these checks.\r\n- Account for operation type when running `validate_function_name` (accounting specifically for `CreateFunction`, `DeleteFunction`, `Invoke`, and `GetFunction`) with sensible defaults being used elsewhere.\r\n- Add new `validate_qualifier` and `construct_validation_exception_message`\r\n\r\nThe Lambda API tests:\r\n- Added new test `test_function_name_and_qualifier_validation` which accounts for a wide range of possible exception cases when attempting validation. \r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nThe below is a test table showing all scenarios tested for `CreateFunction`, `DeleteFunction` `GetFunction` and `Invoke` test types.\r\n\r\nSome considerations:\r\n- The \"Negative Version Number\" and \"Incomplete ARN\" test skips the `create_function` request.\r\n- The \"Function Name Too Long\" test will only fail validation for `create_function` request -- with `ResourceNotFoundException` being thrown for othe types. None are skipped to ensure parity with AWS.\r\n\r\n| Name | Function Name | Qualifier | Skipped Requests |\r\n|------|---------------|-----------|------------------|\r\n| Invalid Function Name | `my-function!` | N/A | None |\r\n| Invalid Qualifier | `my-function` | `invalid!` | None |\r\n| Invalid Account ID | `invalid-account:function:my-function` | N/A | None |\r\n| Invalid Region in ARN |

`arn:aws:lambda:{region_name}:{account_id}:function:my-function` | `$latest` | None |\r\n| Missing Region in ARN | `arn:aws:lambda::{account_id}:function:my-function` | N/A | None |\r\n| Missing Account ID in ARN | `arn:aws:lambda:{region_name}::function:my-function` | N/A | None |\r\n| Misspelled Latest in ARN | `arn:aws:lambda:{region_name}:{account_id}:function:my-function:$LATES` | N/A | None |\r\n\r\n### Additional Pipelines\r\n\r\n#### LocalStack Pro: IAM Policies Enforced\r\n- `ext`: Partial run against tests in `aws/tests/lambda_` and with `ENFORCE_IAM` enabled at [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10457344427)\r\n- `ENV: ENFORCE_IAM=1`\r\n#### LocalStack Community: Multi-Account and Multi-Region\r\n- `multi`: Multi-region/account build at [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/27405) pipeline.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Ensure a multi-account and multi-region test can run for this PR\r\n- [ ] Runs against LocalStack Pro version with IAM enforcement enabled\r\n\r\n## Potential future works\r\n- Extend the operations being tested beyond `CreateFunction`, `DeleteFunction`, `GetFunction`, and `Invoke`\r\n- Look into improving test-coverage and support for multi-account and multi-region operations for the provider.\r\n\r\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nTo support the use-case where a given user needs to deploy an IaC infra that makes references to external resources. Those external resources are given a unique resource ID when creating the resource, so attempting to recreate the exact same resources on LocalStack is not possible.\r\n\r\nThe alternative this PR is proposing is to use a custom tag `_custom_id_` to indicate what the resource ID of a resource ought to be. i.e.:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nawslocal ec2 create-subnet --vpc-id $vpc_id --cidr-block 172.31.112.0/20 --tag-specifications \"ResourceType=subnet,Tags=[{Key=_custom_id_,Value=123456789}]\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhere `1234556789` is the custom ID that's used for the given subnet.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nAllows the use of the of `_custom_id_` tag for VPCs, Subnets and SecurityGroups resources to override the UID that's generated for each resource with the custom one associated to `_custom_id_` key.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix custom ID not showing up on the created resource.\r\n- [x] Add tests for when the custom ID tag is attached.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-15T15:11:37Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-23T13:07:28Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-23T13:07:13Z", "merged_at": "2024-08-23T13:07:13Z", "merge_commit_sha":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported in #11356, we did not support SSE-C for S3. This PR implements it, we still don't encrypt the files locally, but this is irrelevant for the usage, as AWS decrypts objects on the fly, and for now we don't really have a use-case for it.\r\n\r\nI've implemented it following the documentation page: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ServerSideEncryptionCustomerKeys.html\r\n\r\nAnd tried to think of most use-cases, as this is needed for the object-store Rust crate (see https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs/pull/6230) . \r\n\r\nI haven't implemented it for the pre-signed POST yet, this can be done in a follow-up. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement SSE-C parameter validation for `PutObject`, `GetObject`, `HeadObject`, `GetObjectAttributes`, `CopyObject`, `CreateMultipartUpload` and `UploadPart`. \r\n- add some tests around it, positive and negative\r\n- properly return the right fields\r\n\r\nNote: test failure unrelated, it's an OpenSearch failure, not blocking the merge\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

The filtering behavior and content detection heuristics depend on the event source and might differ for ESM and Pipes.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nImplement conditional (i.e., only applies of filter contains data) decoding and re-encoding to make filtering tests pass in ESM v2. It's an ugly hack for now \ud83d\ude2c \r\n\r\n## ESM v1 Implementation\r\n\r\nThe decoding and re-encoding is a hacky idea inspired by:\r\n* `localstack-core/localstack/services/lambda_/event_source_listeners/sqs_event_source_listener.py`\r\n* `localstack.services.lambda_.event_source_listeners.kinesis_event_source_listener.KinesisEventSourceListener._filter_records`\r\n\r\nDynamoDB doesn't implement any of these hacks because the `dynamodb` data field is just taken \"as is\": `localstack.services.lambda_.event_source_listeners.dynamodb_event_source_listener.DynamoDBEventSourceListener._filter_records`\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUsing the existing Lambda ESM test suite to reach parity with ESM v1 for now. We are missing big test coverage for many of these cases and this filtering pre-processing logic is hard to test because we cannot snapshot the event at the filtering stage.\r\n\r\nPipelines:\r\n\r\n* `ext`: Full ext CI run (prevent Pipes regression)\r\n\r\nBuilds:\r\n\r\n* [479879a](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11354/commits/479879ac5c8b9ba4599521ea630a009e55210ae1): [ext](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10388252395) \u2705  (except for flaky kafka persistence test, rerun)\r\n* [a5b2d6d](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11354/commits/a5b2d6d7b4eb74874df1d598a729e254e80950f0): [ext](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10388784196) \u2705 \r\n* [1a6fc72](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11354/commits/1a6fc7239c23b460dcf0aa6c48c5017e0eeefefa): [ext](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10389105562) \u2705  \r\n* [4ca8e58](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11354/commits/4ca8e58356df825db2ca59458a89a0469228cb39): [ext](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10392173789) \u2705 \r\n\r\n\r\n## Limitations\r\n\r\n* One of the big limitations related to filtering is that non-matching events should forward the iterator using sequence number checkpointing. This is currently not implemented neither for the old nor the new implementation. Checkpointing the sequence number per shard should also be used to resume a disabled ESM (not implemented). This could lead to poor performance if many events are filtered out and repeatedly polled until they expire.\r\n* Kinesis in ESM has a duplicated data field during filtering due to how the current heuristic is implemented", "created_at": "2024-08-14T13:08:56Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-14T19:24:49Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-14T19:23:38Z", "merged_at": "2024-08-14T19:23:38Z", "merge_commit_sha":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nRecently updated test `test_import_with_stage_variables` [broke the multi account pipeline](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/27318/workflows/6163beb5-f542-4d1c-836e-7385d6ffe7bc/jobs/234706) because we used a lambda URL function in a non default region which doesn't have certificates. We however need HTTPS by default in the OpenAPI file because AWS does not accept HTTP only requests to lambda URL. \r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a condition to replace the https scheme by http when running against LocalStack, but I've done a small mistake and did not assign the result \ud83d\ude05 \r\nAnyway, this now works, you can validate the fix by running the same test with `TEST_AWS_REGION_NAME=ap-northeast-1` and see it is fixed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- assign the result of the `str.replace`\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nWhile exploring EC2 CloudFormation resources (via CDK) I found that when providing `PublicKeyMaterial` that the deployment failed, since this is not a valid parameter to `create_ssh_key`.\n\nIn this case, we should use `import_ssh_key`.\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n\n* If `PublicKeyMaterial` is present in incoming resource definition, call `import_ssh_key` instead of `create_ssh_key`\n* Add test to capture both behaviours\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported by a user, we had an issue with stage variables when declared via CloudFormation. \r\n\r\nSetting a stage variable to be `TestCasing` would save it as `testCasing`. As stage variables are case sensitive, this is quite an issue. \r\n\r\nI've tracked down the issue to be because we would call `keys_to_lower` on the parameters, which would change the casing.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I've added more tests around stage variables and their casing without CFN, and more validation about what the user was encoutering (the stage variable wouldn't be found, which would create an HTTP integration URI to not have a host). \r\n\r\nI've also found a small issue with how we would import OpenAPI/Swagger files for the method used for the integration for HTTP/HTTP_PROXY.\r\n\r\nResources:\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fr_fr/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-stage.html#cfn-apigateway-stage-variables\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- fix the CloudFormation `Stage` resource for APIGW, picking up the stage variables before the `keys_to_lower` call and using deep copy because of the nested dicts\r\n- update a validated test to check the fix and casing\r\n- update another test related to Stage Variables but not CFN, just to check behavior (also add a negative test for NextGen only)\r\n- add better exception handler for `HTTP` & `HTTP_PROXY` NextGen integrations, can still be improved with negative testing, we just need to find how to trigger them\r\n\r\n<!--

This PR unifies Pipes dead letter config and Lambda ESM failure destinations. Unfortunately, there are some more subtle differences than I hoped for, but being able to convert an ESM config into a Pipe dead letter config in the factory is quite neat.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Add support for Lambda ESM failure destinations\r\n* Unify `send_events_to_dlq` for ESM and Pipes and Kinesis and DynamoDB Streams\r\n* Re-validate some snapshots & increase timeout for AWS (after running into flake)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nUsing the existing Lambda ESM test suite to reach parity with ESM v1 for now.\r\n\r\nPipelines:\r\n\r\n* `ext`: Full ext CI run (prevent Pipes regression)\r\n* `multi`: Multi-accout/region pipeline: trigger [here](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack?branch=unify-esm-failure-destinations) once previous run is done to avoid cancelling it\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilds:\r\n\r\n* [eda1814](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11337/commits/eda18147cebdac7028899d52016734c69372b5b1)\r\n  * \u2705

How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- As we already had support for `CommaDelimitedList` for Cfn parameters, the support was extended for ssm parameters\r\n- A test was added to prevent regression\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* Provide correct regions for various internal clients\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs talked about in https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/11253#issuecomment-2271700499, we could use the same trace-id throughout the invocation, this was left as a TODO. I have a bit of time, so I implemented it quickly. \r\n\r\nIt seems the Lambda integration is overwriting the trace header for now, so it is hard to test. It might be done with a regular AWS integration, to SQS for example. We can work on this as a follow-up. \r\n\r\nThe implementation is pretty simple for now, I've written an AWS test to check how AWS populate the trace-id in a naive way. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement a trace-id field to the context so that it is accessible throughout the invocation\r\n- add a util to generate a trace and parse a trace and some unit tests around it\r\n- adding the newly generated trace-id field where we would generate a random id before\r\n- add the logic to populate the missing part of an incoming trace if there is one, or generate a full one\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\nWe are currently missing the `LAMBDA_PREBUILD_IMAGES` environment variable in the CLI env var flags, which is added in this commit.\nI also ordered the LAMBDA section of the list alphabetically.\n\nIn addtion to this, similar as in -ext, I readded the `make docker-build` target, so developers can build the image easily again, without having to look up the variables necessary for the `docker-helper.sh`.\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* Add `LAMBDA_PREBUILD_IMAGES` to CI env vars\n* Readd `docker-build` make target\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhile testing against the real AWS, it seems the `AccessDenied` exception is special, and the `message` field in the default JSON response is capitalized, even though the default template for the `ACCESS_DENIED` GatewayResponse is the same as all others: `{\"message\":$context.error.messageString}`, so the CRUD layer is once again wrong for the default values. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- add a special case until we handle the `responseTemplate` where we will override the default value for `AccessDenied `\r\n- add a unit test to prevent regression \r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

Follow-up PRs will handle the refactoring of the util usage & cleaning up the utils.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nI've also already tested refactoring the covered utils into NO-OPs. Both Community and -ext need minor adjustments to some providers for that to work which I'll do in follow-up PRs. Seems to be working quite nicely though. :+1: \r\n", "created_at": "2024-08-05T14:30:26Z", "updated_at": "2024-08-14T15:25:28Z", "closed_at": "2024-08-14T15:25:27Z", "merged_at":

comment from @cloutierMat that everything is \"test\" \"test\" and that is was a bit unclear\r\n- fix the value for `pathParameters` in APIGW NG (if there are no values, it's `None` for AWS_PROXY)\r\n- fix how we remove the leading slashes for a path in order to properly route a request, but keep them for the `requestContext.path` value which is stage + path\r\n\r\nUpstream run

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThe debugging of Lambda functions is currently hampered by the need to manually manage or disable execution timeouts, which often do not provide enough time to connect a remote debugger and perform the necessary evaluations. This issue is particularly relevant for services like Lambda and API Gateway. By default, Lambda limits execution to three seconds, though it can be configured for up to 15 minutes, while API Gateway can impose its own timeout on integrations.\r\nTo enhance the developer experience when debugging Lambda functions, this pull request (PR) proposes introducing a \"Debug Mode.\" This mode would signal to the system that the deployment is in a debugging phase, allowing any provider to adjust relevant settings, such as timeouts, accordingly. The changes also suggest setting a default timeout value and implementing dynamic timeout adjustments that do not alter the system's static state. This ensures compatibility with persistence logic and maintains readability of timeout values during debugging, improving transparency and reducing potential distractions.\r\nThis initial effort will be followed by a more substantial configurable pattern designed to enable debugging across multiple Lambda functions simultaneously when in Debug Mode.\r\nThe new recommended command for starting LocalStack for the debug of lambda functions is now: \r\n`LAMBDA_DEBUG_MODE=1 LAMBDA_DOCKER_FLAGS='-p 19891:19891' localstack start`\r\n\r\n_Note that API Gateway was found to not strictly enforce the evaluation of Lambda functions within its set integration timeouts. Instead, it ensures that the process is halted after the maximum Lambda execution time is reached. This behaviour has been maintained, with an extended timeout applied when in Debug Mode. However, enforcing timeouts in API Gateway should be considered in future efforts._\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- addition of the `LAMBDA_DEBUG_MODE` environment variable and related support constants and functions\r\n- addition of automatic lambda evaluation timeout increase when in debug mode\r\n- addition of automatic API Gateway timeout increase when in debug mode\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nIt got reported in our Slack community channel that there was an issue with pre-signed URL and the S3 image. \r\n\r\nThis is a regression introduced by #10265, to allow users to use credentials created by LocalStack to pre-signed URL. However, this introduced a dependency on `moto` which the tests did not catch. \r\n\r\nI'm still a bit surprised how it hasn't been caught, but I think our current setup to run the tests inside the docker container might make so that `moto` is installed inside it. At some point we should revisit the setup to have the tests run outside the container and against the built image (almost there!).\r\n\r\nTrying to access a pre-signed URL in the S3 image raises the following exception:\r\n```python\r\nlocalstack-test  | 2024-08-01T14:01:07.994  INFO --- [et.reactor-0] localstack.request.aws     : AWS s3.GetObject => 500 (InternalError); None/None; GetObjectRequest(None, headers={'Host': 'localhost:4566', 'Sec-Fetch-Site': 'none', 'Connection': 'keep-alive', 'Upgrade-Insecure-Requests': '1', 'Sec-Fetch-Mode': 'navigate', 'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8', 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/17.4.1 Safari/605.1.15', 'Accept-Language': 'en-US,en;q=0.9', 'Sec-Fetch-Dest': 'document', 'Accept-Encoding': 'gzip, deflate'}); InternalError(exception while calling s3.GetObject: Traceback (most recent call last):\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/.venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/rolo/gateway/chain.py\", line 166, in handle\r\nlocalstack-test  |     handler(self, self.context, response)\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/localstack-core/localstack/aws/handlers/presigned_url.py\", line 23, in __call__\r\nlocalstack-test  |     handler(chain, context, response)\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/localstack-core/localstack/services/s3/presigned_url.py\", line 198, in __call__\r\nlocalstack-test  |     validate_presigned_url_s3(context)\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/localstack-core/localstack/services/s3/presigned_url.py\", line 319, in validate_presigned_url_s3\r\nlocalstack-test  |     credentials = get_credentials_from_parameters(query_parameters)\r\nlocalstack-test  |                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/localstack-core/localstack/services/s3/presigned_url.py\", line 242, in get_credentials_from_parameters\r\nlocalstack-test  |     if not (secret_access_key := get_secret_access_key_from_access_key_id(access_key_id)):\r\nlocalstack-test  |                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\r\nlocalstack-test  |   File \"/opt/code/localstack/localstack-core/localstack/services/s3/presigned_url.py\", line 261, in get_secret_access_key_from_access_key_id\r\nlocalstack-test  |     from moto.iam.models import AccessKey, iam_backends\r\nlocalstack-test  | ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'moto'\r\nlocalstack-test  | , headers={'Content-Type': 'application/xml', 'Content-Length': '1491', 'x-amz-request-id': '0777e3a2-2ef7-4169-985d-e54339473bec', 'x-amz-id-2': 's9lzHYrFp76ZVxRcpX9+5cjAnEH2ROuNkd2BHfIa6UkFVdtjf5mKR3/eTPFvsiP/XV/VLi31234='})\r\n```\r\n\r\n\\cc @HarshCasper for the community channel issue, thanks for helping the user!\r\nhttps://localstack-community.slack.com/archives/CMAFN2KSP/p1722017331093119\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\nWith #10912 we introduced some fixes regarding returning proper ARNs in non-default partitions.\n\nHowever, some have been missed, uncovered due to recently modified or added tests.\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* Use proper partition placeholders in tests or use the correct partition for manually generated ARNs in tests\n* Events returns the correct partition in the generated ARN for root account principal ARNs on `put_permission` calls.\n\nMore fixes for events and resourcegroups are in getmoto/moto#7913\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n-->\n",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nTo receive incoming events in their final form (after all transformers have been applied) a new proxy function is introduced in TargetSender. \r\nThis proxy function is patched with the extension EventStduio in this PR: https://github.com/localstack/localstack-extension-event-studio/pull/26\r\nIn addition, the PR also introduces event-bus-name as a new field for the Event, required by the extension.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- add proxy_send_event in TargetSender\r\n- add additional field `event-bus-name` to Event\r\n\r\n", "created_at":

https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11275 we have seen that the release helper currently does not properly add the `version.py` to the git commits for the release / version increments.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\nThis PR addresses this issue by:\r\n- Setting sane defaults for bash settings in the `release-helper.sh` (`set -euo pipefail`, `shopt -s nullglob`) and for variable default assignments (use `:-` instead of `:` in order to also use defaults for empty but set variables).\r\n- Also explicitly enables `globstar` tto fix the issue that the glob does not detect files in subdirectories properly.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTested with the following script which basically shows our release workflow:\r\n```bash\r\nmake install\r\nunset VERSION_PY\r\nunset VERSION_FILE\r\nunset DEPENDENCY_FILE\r\n\r\n# set release version 0.0.0\r\nbin/release-helper.sh set-ver 0.0.0\r\npip install -e .\r\nbin/release-helper.sh git-commit-release 0.0.0\r\n\r\n# set version increment\r\nbin/release-helper.sh set-ver 0.0.1.dev\r\npip install -e .\r\nbin/release-helper.sh git-commit-increment\r\n\r\n# show commits and reset\r\ngit show HEAD\r\ngit show HEAD^\r\ngit reset --hard HEAD~2\r\n```", "created_at": "2024-07-31T14:09:02Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-31T14:58:47Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-31T14:58:45Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-31T14:58:45Z", "merge_commit_sha":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nRecords the AWS behaviour when a Lambda URL is created for an aliased version of a Lambda function; and then the alias is deleted post-creation of the URL.\r\n\r\nThe current behaviour is that the Lambda URL will remain. I believe a parity test for this edge-case is nesessary since the ARN of the function URL still points to the alias.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Single new test-case added called `test_lambda_url_persists_after_alias_delete` to test the above flow.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section:

Fixing (or breaking?) the datetime parsing / server-side decoding was implemented in #11071.\r\n- After quite some time, it turned out that the CBOR implementation still causes issues with the AWS Java SDK, which were addressed with #11133.\r\n  - This PR implemented a more thorough support for CBOR, but unfortunately added a small regression.\r\n- This regression (blob parsing in requests) has been fixed by @simonrw with #11220.\r\n- But there's another regression which was introduced with #11133:\r\n  - The new proper datetime handling is still not compatible with the AWS SDK v2 (as outlined in #11216 and #11271).\r\n\r\nThis PR is hopefully the last PR on that matter, fixing the CBOR datetime handling in Kinesis for the AWS SDK v2, and introducing a better test coverage to avoid any kind of regressions in the future.\r\nIt turns out that the issue really only is that the datetime is encoded as a floating point number, instead of an integer (which most CBOR decoders can decode, but not the one in the AWS SDK v2).\r\n\r\nFixes #11216\r\nFixes #11271\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Send the datetime as unixtime milliseconds as integer.\r\n- Cleans up some test.\r\n- Introduces a Lambda -> Kinesis test using the AWS SDK v2.\r\n  - This new test uses a lambda which is added to `tests/aws/services/lambda_/functions/common/`, because these lambdas are already automatically built and cached across CI runs.\r\n  - @joe4dev @dfangl: I hope this is okay, maybe this could be evolved towards a concept which is usable for multiple services. I feel like we often have the problem that some edge cases are super-hard to test in Python (especially when it comes to certain peculiarities in SDKs of other languages). At the same time these tests are not really testing Lambda (which is why they should not really be part of the Lambda tests).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nDuring development I used a simple snippet (with AWS SDK v2 version 2.20.43) to verify the reported issues:\r\n```\r\nKinesisClient kinesisClient = KinesisClient.builder()\r\n        .endpointOverride(new URI(\"http://localhost.localstack.cloud:4566\"))\r\n        .credentialsProvider(() -> AwsBasicCredentials.create(\"test\", \"test\"))\r\n        .region(Region.US_EAST_1)\r\n        .build();\r\nkinesisClient.createStream(CreateStreamRequest.builder().streamName(\"test-stream\").shardCount(1).build());\r\nDescribeStreamResponse describeStream = kinesisClient.describeStream(DescribeStreamRequest.builder().streamName(\"test-stream\").streamARN(\"arn:aws:kinesis:us-east-1:000000000000:stream/test-stream\").build());\r\nSystem.out.println(describeStream.streamDescription().streamCreationTimestamp());\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] Implement Lambda -> Kinesis test using the AWS Java SDK v2.\r\n- [x] Describe the binary signature test in `test_kinesis` a bit more in detail.\r\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n\n## Motivation\n\nDuring the migration to the new runtime ([PR 1 adding the new runtime](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/10942), [PR 2 removing the old runtime](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11202)), the `DEVELOP` live debugging functionality was missed. This workflow, coupled with using `localstack.dev.run` is crucial for debugging parts of LocalStack that _only_ work when run from a container, e.g. testing inter-container Docker networking via services.\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n\n## Changes\n\n- Add the previous `DEVELOP` functionality back, including launching the `debugpy` debugger\n  - enable the feature with `DEVELOP=1`\n  - pause the LocalStack start on debugger connection with `WAIT_FOR_DEBUGGER=1`\n  - configure the port used by `debugpy` with `DEVELOP_PORT` (default: 5678)\n- Fix a bug in `localstack.dev.run` where community only entrypoints were not being mounted from the correct place (when launched from a community checkout)\n- Fix a bug in `localstack.dev.run` where community and pro entrypoints were not being mounted from the correct place (when launched from a pro checkout)\n- Add convenience properties on `HostPaths` to access source code checkout paths on the host\n\n## Testing\n\n* checkout `master`\n* run `localstack.dev.run --mount-entrypoints`\n    * notice that the community entrypoints file is not mounted into the container\n* checkout this PR\n* run `localstack.dev.run --mount-entrypoints`\n    * notice that the community entrypoints file **is** mounted into the container\n* run `localstack.dev.run --mount-entrypoints --develop`\n    * notice that the logs indicate that `debugpy` is being installed, and is available on port 5678\n    \n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n-->", "created_at": "2024-07-30T11:06:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-30T20:12:01Z", "closed_at":

The Lambda service owners also discussed this in the last Lambda Service Owner Sync (2024-07-15).\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* [Unify helper utils for common operating systems](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/commit/d087e5bd64a9b728173053c10c845deadff78a8e)\r\n* [Change default for Lambda port expose on macOS in host mode](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/commit/ae3a0c52eba2ba7ff3d4f45d0e3736eecdb2bbaf)\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOur test suite should capture any regressions. Anything else to consider? Is there a special environment where the assumption `not is_in_docker == host mode` does not apply (e.g., K8) @dfangl @simonrw?\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nOptions considered:\r\n\r\n- Option A: simply evaluate based on is_in_docker and the system platform, assuming `not is_in_docker == host mode`.\r\n    - Mixing up config logic with production code makes config bugs more likely and leads to

removed after being deprecated for a long time.\r\nThis is causing quite some issues (see https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/4519).\r\nFor `localstack-ext`, this hits JPype, where a PR has been created to fix the issue:\r\n- https://github.com/jpype-project/jpype/pull/1206\r\n\r\nFor as long as this package has not been upgraded, or the `setuptools` version has been yanked, we need to find a workaround.\r\nThis PR creates and uses a pip constraints file in order to avoid `setuptools>=72.0.0`.\r\nAs soon as either JPype have been fixed or the `setuptools` version has been yanked, we can revert this commit / use the latest version of `setuptools` again.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Adds a `pip-constraints.txt` file declaring to avoid `setuptools>=72.0.0`.\r\n- Sneaks in the `PIP_CONSTRAINT` environment variable to be used with `pip` everywhere.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- Currently all pipelines are broken (at least those where the cache was invalidated today).\r\n- If the pipelines are green with this PR, we can be quite sure that it works correctly.", "created_at": "2024-07-29T10:20:03Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-29T13:28:51Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-29T13:28:27Z", "merged_at": null,

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n- This PR is a followup to https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11103 that adds support for including an alias when constructing a custom predictble URL\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Including an existing `alias` in the `Qualifier` parameter when running a [CreateFunctionUrlConfig](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/api/API_CreateFunctionUrlConfig.html) will create a compound custom URL in the form `<custom-id-value>-<qualifier-or-alias>`.\r\n- Remove comment from previous PR outlining noting to add this functionality.\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n- Ran all `only_localstack` tests in the `TestLambdaUrl` suite.\r\n- Tested against local instance using `awslocal`.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Update the [Lambda docs](https://docs.localstack.cloud/user-guide/aws/lambda/) to include these changes in a follow-up PR.\r\n- [x] Currently, deleting an alias does not remove it's corresponding URL (verified via CLI) -- there should be a parity test checking whether this is intended functionality.\r\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported in #11253, our Edge Router had issue with `path` parameter starting with multiple slashes, as it would return a redirect which we shouldn't do. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new converter in the default `ROUTER`, which is the one we already use internally for the OP Router for AWS, and also internally for the new generation APIGW. \r\n\r\nThis PR introduces the change and uses the new converter for APIGW routes, and fixes the behavior around it, with added integration test cases. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- migrate the `GreedyPathConverter` to `edge.py` as we need to use it in our default router, and refactor its usages\r\n- add new tests for the router with the greedy path converter\r\n- fix APIGW NG behavior with the new greedy path \r\n- fix the legacy APIGW, which was a bit more tricky, I'll run tests from upstream as well to be sure we're not breaking behavior\r\n\r\nNote: failing tests are unrelated, and I'm running upstream full test suite to validate the changes which is green. Failing tests will be addressed with #11261\r\n\r\n_fixes #11253_\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's

We can also leverage the new implementation of EventBridge Pipes to provide a better implementation with improved [AWS Parity](https://blog.localstack.cloud/2022-08-04-parity-explained/), more reliability, better performance, and better test coverage.\r\nThe PR https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11231 moved the shared implementation into the open-source repository to enable this unification.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Add feature flag `LAMBDA_EVENT_SOURCE_MAPPING` upon creating an event source mapping in the Lambda provider\r\n* Add CI step `itest-lambda-event-source-mapping-v2-feature` to test the new ESM v2 feature\r\n* Introduce feature flag `LAMBDA_EVENT_SOURCE_MAPPING` enabling customers to opt-in v2 (v1 remains the default for now)\r\n* Add `EsmConfigFactory` that takes a `CreateEventSourceMappingRequest` and returns an `EventSourceMappingConfiguration` with the right defaults\r\n* Add `EsmEventProcessor` that implements the Lambda Event Source Mapping logic\r\n* Add `EsmWorker` that handles thread management and lifecycle state updates\r\n* Add `EsmWorkerFactory` that instantiates the correct pollers, lambda sender, and a NoOpsPipeLogger (used for systematic debug logging)\r\n* Add `kinesis_namespace` flag to Kinesis poller to control special formatting used for Lambda ESM\r\n* Fix event payload encoding using base64 BytesEncoder for binary content (e.g., DynamoDB binary values)\r\n* [Fix message attributes in SQS poller](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11267/commits/9e44a6e031d7980a707bb22b3972930d8f332078)\r\n* [Customize state transition reason depending on event source](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/11267/commits/508b7b3a78e1588a4a5864ac170d06d5ca378f3e): The SQS event source uses a different status string \ud83d\ude43 \r\n* Add basic lifecycle updates (definitely needs a follow up and better test coverage)\r\n\r\nDesign overview:\r\n![lambda-esm-v2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6566e854-86a7-444c-9235-40695d5f3d32)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Mainly using the regression tests from Lambda ESM v1 for now, but test coverage needs to be improved. Some tests are skipped for Lambda ESM v2 and will be tackled in coming iterations to fix known regressions.\r\n* \u26a0\ufe0f The localstack-ext tests for EventBridge pipes should also be triggered before merging changes of the shared code that could potentially break the Pipes implementation\r\n* Started CDK-based tests for SQS but moved them into the separate branch `lambda-esm-sqs-cdk-testing`\r\n\r\n### CI\r\n\r\n* Full localstack-ext pipeline:\r\n  * [localstack-ext Tests](https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10182382461)\r\n* [MA/MR

poller is currently not handled leading to many issues -> refactoring and fixing should follow in a separate PR\r\n* Lifecycle updates (i.e., EsmState) implementation very basic\r\n* ESM updates and deletion implementation is minimalistic\r\n* Persistence not yet implemented\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix or skip any failing tests\r\n- [x] Run full localstack-ext CI to detect potential regressions for EventBridge Pipes sharing code with Lambda ESM v2: https://github.com/localstack/localstack-ext/actions/runs/10182382461\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-25T20:43:24Z",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhile running the pipeline to check for the release, `test_transcribe_happy_path` flaked again. It is also marked flaky on CircleCI. \r\n\r\nSee failures: \r\n- https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/26973/workflows/543f0989-034b-4f92-bfbb-584da606b29b/jobs/230534/tests\r\n- https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/26997/workflows/4031f23f-ef93-4557-b000-588789e68c6a/jobs/230767\r\n- https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/26997/workflows/4031f23f-ef93-4557-b000-588789e68c6a/jobs/230769\r\n\r\nWe're using the same logic as in opensearch tests, where a check in the global AWS `conftest.py` checks if there are any tests in the test collection that would match the test parent (test file or test class), and if there is, we already trigger the async download of the dependencies early. When there is the test selection, this does not do a lot, but for full-runs it will help the dependencies being downloaded before the actually tests run.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this issue, I'm using a class fixture pre-downloading the dependencies with a longer timeout, but with a quick failure mode, to avoid waiting on the transcription job if it fails asynchronously\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- setup pre-downloading of Vosk, ffmpeg and the Vosk model used\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nRunning the pipeline a few times to be sure it's hardened:\r\n- \u2705 https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/localstack/localstack/27020/workflows/b35769d6-3dca-46bb-8c96-9b896193f270\r\n-  \u2705

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs needed upstream, to allow greater flexibility, we would need a handler to modify the request after it has been parsed. \r\nWe also need a small refactor in order to be able to act on the context from the `Endpoint`. \r\n\r\nWe can merge this after the 3.6 release as it will break upstream dependencies. \r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- add a composite handler\r\n- refactor the endpoint\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Use expression attribute names (see [docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Expressions.ExpressionAttributeNames.html)) in the `Scan` operation to avoid the mentioned issue.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section:

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThere was a TODO left regarding the Exception to be raised when we have a routing error. This one of the bad one in APIGW, where it will raise a 403 exception when you're trying to send a request to something you haven't defined. \r\n\r\nFrom the documentation:\r\n> The gateway response for a missing authentication token error, including the cases when the client attempts to invoke an unsupported API method or resource.\r\n\r\nIn some raised exceptions, I've also forgot to add log statements to help the user to understand why it is raising an exception.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement the `MissingAuthenticationToken` exception when we have a routing exception\r\n- write an AWS validated test\r\n- add missing log statements\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

`test_edge.py`\r\nOne of the tests in the module for example [failed in this

server might not be up when the connection is being established.\r\nThis PR tries to fix this by explicitly waiting for the proxy to be up before trying to establish a connection.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Use `wait_is_up` on proxy server before trying to establish a connection to address potential race condition / flakiness.", "created_at": "2024-07-23T11:28:18Z", "updated_at":

Otherwise, it returns the name of the security group. If you omit the VpcId property and need the ID of the VPC, use Fn::GetAtt instead.\n\n[source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-ec2-securitygroup.html#aws-resource-ec2-securitygroup-return-values-ref)\n\nCloses #11120\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR aims at bringing a higher level of parity with apigateway headers. Some headers when not passed through appropriately will fail the invocation.\r\n\r\nAs noted on the [Important Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-known-issues.html) of the Api Gateway documention, some headers are either, dropped, passthrough or remapped from the users requests and following data transformations.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nA series of header manipulation in the handlers was added.\r\n#### Invocation\r\n(parsing handler)\r\n- Some headers are not making it into the context, for these we prevent populating them to the `InvocationRequest` when first parsing the incoming request (This change was introduces by #11227 )\r\n#### Request\r\n( integration request handler)\r\n- For HTTP_PPROXY integration, while most headers available to the context are passed through to the integration request, some seem to be removed BEFORE applying the mapping templates.\r\n- A set of headers will raise an `InternalServerError` if modified by request parameters of mapping templates. Even for `AWS_PROXY` where they are not applied, go figure :smile: \r\n- Some request headers are dropped after being applied.\r\n- Some request headers are default and we only apply them if not already set by the templates\r\n#### Response\r\n( method response handler)\r\n- Some headers are remapped with `x-amzn-Remapped-`\r\n- Some headers are dropped\r\n- Some headers are added as default if not set by the integration response. For example, `Connection`, seems to be taking from the original requests `Connection`\r\n \r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n~This PR is based on #11227 and #11226.~\r\n\r\nAs part of the header remapping work, it has been shown by @cloutierMat that `HTTP_PROXY` integration still supported Request Parameters Mappings, which isn't exactly documented.\r\n\r\nTo properly support this (and also Private API in the future), it made sense to always create an `IntegrationRequest` object to attach to the context so that the PROXY integration can use it: they don't need to render their own URI. \r\n\r\nI've also sneaked a little fix to a bug put into light by our tests: Lambda URL did not support multi value query string parameters. I've simplified the logic there and also wrote a specific test for it. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- refactor IntegrationRequest handler to always create an IntegrationRequest and attach it to the context\r\n- refactor `AWS_PROXY` and especially `HTTP_PROXY` to make use of the new IntegrationRequest (AWS_PROXY still needs the Invocation Request, as it needs quite a lot of the original request data)\r\n- fixed Lambda URL multi value query string\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Therefore, we need to move the shared infrastructure from LocalStack pro into community.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nMove shared code for Pipes and ESM into community, in particular:\r\n- Pipes ASF API: `localstack-pro-core/localstack_ext/aws/api/pipes/**init**.py` (see detailed internal discussion in #sig-localstack 01.07.2024 regarding moving Pipes API specs into community)\r\n- Pollers: `localstack-pro-core/localstack_ext/services/pipes/pollers`\r\n    - all (currently no ext-specific ones)\r\n- Senders: `localstack-pro-core/localstack_ext/services/pipes/senders/`\r\n    - `sender.py`\r\n    - `lambda_sender.py`\r\n- EventProcessor interface:\r\n    - `localstack-pro-core/localstack_ext/services/pipes/event_processor.py`\r\n    - NoOpsEventProcessor\r\n- Loggers:\r\n    - interface + noops loggers for better logging experience in Lambda ESM\r\n\r\nImports were updates were necessary, but no functional changes have been made in this refactoring.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nPipes test suite should catch potential regressions.", "created_at": "2024-07-18T12:31:29Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-18T15:03:15Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-18T15:03:13Z", "merged_at":

More info can be found in https://github.com/localstack/plux/issues/23.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Temporarily replaces `plux entrypoints` with `setup plugins egg_info` to avoid the absolute path in `SOURCES.txt`.\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- See https://github.com/localstack/plux/issues/23 for more infos on how to reproduce the issue / test the fix.\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-18T10:52:34Z",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAs discussed with @bentsku, to simplify the usage of headers through the invocation, we will only keep the Werzeug headers as part of the context. We were mostly using the `raw_headers` through the handlers anyway, so it makes sense to only keep them in the context.\r\n\r\nThis is also in preparation to a refactor that will move some of the duplicate code in the integration handlers to the integration request handler.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- `InvocationContext` gets rid of `raw_headers` and `multi_value_headers`. The value of header is what used to be known as `raw_headers`\r\n- `IntegrationRequest` type for `headers` is now a Werkzeug `Headers`\r\n- Various fixes through the handlers to fully support the new types\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\n- [x] Currently targeting #11226 to allow for ci-pipeline with Next Gen enabled. Rebase and target master once merge\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported by #11224, we had an issue when the body of an S3 object was empty with a CRC32 checksum. \r\nThis was due to a flawed logic always considering the `Checksum.update()` was called, and not properly initializing the checksum object.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- fix the logic in the CRC32 util\r\n- add a test with an empty body to assert the fix\r\n- update a previous test which did not declare the checksum trailing header, which made the test not validate the checksum\r\n\r\n_fixes #11224_\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\n\nA report from a customer showed that a round trip of data through a Kinesis stream from LocalStack did not preserve the data content.\n\nFor example:\n\n* `PutRecord` in Kinesis stream, `\"test data\"`\n* `GetRecords` from kinesis stream, convert 1st record to `String`, which turns out different from \"test data\": `\ufffd\ufffd-u\ufffdZ`\n\nThey were using the Java SDK. When testing on AWS, a `GetRecords` request returns the message body (decoded as a String) of `\"test data\"` correctly.\n\nSince this is exercised via the Java SDK, it is the handling of the [CBOR](https://cbor.io/) format that it as fault. It turned out that we did not parse `CBOR` `blob`s correctly.\n\n* #11133 made some changes to the CBOR parsing to do with timestamps milliseconds vs seconds.\n* As part of this change, the [`BaseJSONRequestParser._parse_blob`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/a4095638a6c92a70e15aebb07b9520e8907c3e50/localstack-core/localstack/aws/protocol/parser.py#L894-L901) method was removed.\n* This meant that blob data types (like plain strings) were parsed using the [`RequestParser._parse_blob`](https://github.com/localstack/localstack/blob/a87cba7f0308262aa518368236700a20855a411e/localstack-core/localstack/aws/protocol/parser.py#L297-L299) method, which incorrectly base64-decoded the value.\n* This PR also updated `tests/unit/aws/protocol/test_parser.py::test_json_cbor_blob_parsing` to test this incorrect behaviour.\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n\nThis PR reverts the removal of `BaseJSONRequestParser._parse_blob` and updates the relevant test accordingly.\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ] ...\n-->",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe're planning to advertise the new implementation of API Gateway \"Next Gen\" in the next release.\r\n\r\nHowever, we will need all our implementation of API Gateway (with upstream) to be on the same page, and to not try to register the same routes with different implementations. \r\n\r\nThis PR makes sure we override the different versions of APIGW to use the new implementation if the flag is set.\r\n\r\nAlso sneaked a small refactor we've talked with @cloutierMat in order to be easier to override behavior. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- update `apigatewayv2` and `apigatewaymanagementapi` to also use `next_gen` if set. \r\n- small refactor for the endpoint\r\n\r\n<!--

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWe introduced the cloudwatch v2 provider a few months ago. \r\nThere hasn't been a lot adoption yet, but the new provider was able to resolve some reported issues already. \r\n\r\nMoving forward, the new provider should be the default, so we also get more feedback and can fix potential oversights and issues only in the new provider.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n* switch the `default` provider to use v2\r\n* adapt the `old_provider` check for the test-skips\r\n* adapt the circleci config to run the test suite also for v1\r\n* fix some parameters for the composite alarm (revealed by a cloudformation test)\r\n* re-create snapshot for cloudformation test and adapt transformers\r\n* add the state-visitor pattern to v2 provider to fix persistence issue with cloudpods\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section:

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhen resolving the references in the cloudformation template for `Fn::GetAtt` we do not consider the attribute sub name. For example: \r\nIn `\"Fn::GetAtt\": \"ChildParam.Outputs.Value\"`, where attribute reference is `ChildParam.Outputs.Value` the:\r\n- resource logical id is `ChildParam`\r\n- attribute name is `Outputs`\r\n \r\nwe do not further consider to fetch the `Value` attribute from the resource properties. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\nThis PR:\r\n- adds an additional attribute subname if it exists and gets it value from the resource properties of the model instance. \r\n- adds an AWS validated test to verify the results. \r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/localstack/localstack/issues/11128\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nTwo operations are allowed to take place across the account border, one the one hand sending events from one event bridge bus to another one in a different account, on the other using `put_events` to put events directly to an event bridge bus in another account - if the permissions are set correctly.\r\nTo enforce IAM policies localstack relies internally on target arns - and the request must originate with the source account id.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Use the event bus target arn for internal `put_events` with TargetSenders\r\n- Use the event bus target arn if provided to extract the region and account id to load the store for the target account id and region from the account region bundle\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\nAdd a validated test for `put_events` directly into another account.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ]

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThe Bookstore tests show flaky behavior, which was supposed to be mitigated by ...\r\nThat PR fixed the usage of the cache for OpenSearch installation.\r\nHowever, it can still lead to issues, because the version used for OpenSearch in the Bookstore test is not the default version and thus needs to be downloaded extra. This might again lead to rate limiting issues.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- This PR upgrades the Bookstore test to use the current default version of OpenSearch (2.11). \r\n- To facilitate that, it also fixes the responses given by the compatible version check in the new version and skips some of the new keys that are in the response\r\n- For the fix of the version output, two of the opensearch tests were converted to snapshot tests and validated against AWS. This will make changes like these easier in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n- The Bookstore test should be more stable now\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-15T13:00:39Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-16T15:07:09Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-16T15:07:07Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-16T15:07:07Z", "merge_commit_sha": "6aafbcdebade24b26705913cbc413dc7d50dad7a", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 5361521728, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JUQA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20patch", "name": "semver: patch", "color": "2ECC71", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in patch releases"}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11207/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11207/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/11207/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/a172e8b8bba99f7379bd13f936b4b4c78a70dd03", "head": {"label": "localstack:upgrade-bookstore-test", "ref": "upgrade-bookstore-test", "sha": "a172e8b8bba99f7379bd13f936b4b4c78a70dd03", "user": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 71948498, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==", "name": "localstack", "full_name": "localstack/localstack", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack", "description": "\ud83d\udcbb A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis is a PR to remove the code that was deprecated by #10942.\r\n\r\nI left `signal_supervisor_restart()` in the legacy module (it's still referenced in ext), but added a TODO.\r\n\r\nConsidering this a minor change since we never documented `LEGACY_RUNTIME` and have, to my knowledge, not needed it so far.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* `infra.py` has been completely removed in favor of the new runtime framework\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\nOne thing needs manual testing, namely the kill function of the health endpoint\r\n* run `python -m localstack.dev.run -e DEBUG=1`\r\n* observe that `curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/health -d '{\"action\": \"kill\"}'` still works\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR refactors our usage of the handler chain: we would make use of response handlers to mutate the response in place, and that defeated the extensibility. \r\nAlso, exception handlers were affected by the response handlers and it did not make a lot of sense regarding the architecture of APIGW. \r\n\r\nNow, all handlers are request handlers, passing data around in the context. Only the last handler is responsible for serializing the response.\r\n\r\nWe could arguably already serialize the response in the `_PROXY` integrations, but we will most probably add additional serialization logic in the Method Response handler regarding remapped headers.\r\n\r\nThis will also enable us to create response handlers which will extend the behavior, for example read all data from the context (which is mostly added and not mutated except for variables) and log it in a response handler. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- refactor Integration Response and Method Response handlers to be request handlers. \r\n- create 2 new attributes for the context, to return what is called the \"endpoint response\" in AWS (the integration response, but the naming is confusing), and the actual \"integration response\" after mapping when the integration is not of type proxy\r\n- refactor Integration handler to not serialize the response anymore but attach it to the context\r\n- modify unit tests to the new logic\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nsuccessful full-run with the flag forced:

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAWS Step Functions allows for the manual interruption of [sync](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-sync) and [sync2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-stepfunctions.html) integration patterns via manual notification using the task's `TaskToken`; workflows otherwise reserved for `waitForTokenTask` [integrations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/connect-to-resource.html#connect-wait-token). \r\nThis means that not only can `$$.Task.Token` context value be accessed in `sync` and `sync2` workflows that also support `waitForTaskToken`; but that also `sync(2)` workflows needs to listen for callbacks on that task token.\r\nSuch scenario is currently not supported by the StepFunctions v2 interpreter, which instead either synchronises with the service task via `sync` and `sync2`, or awaits for task callbacks via `waitForTaskToken`. This PR adds such functionality.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Reworked the Callback service superclass to handle sync and callback workflows\r\n    - sync listener routine is moved to this class and extended to listen for callbacks if available\r\n    - in order to not instantiate sync resources (such as clients and job details) on every sync check, a builder pattern was added to ensure service integrations instantiate such values only once\r\n- Propagated builder pattern to all service integrations supporting callback logics\r\n- Added relevant scenario test with manual interrupt of sync workflow\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR implements the last missing integration: `AWS`. This integration allows API Gateway to interact with other AWS services, by constructing mostly manually a request following the service specs (APIGW will take of the signing and endpoint mostly, and in some case it helps directing the request to the right operation).\r\n\r\nThere are 2 kind of AWS integrations: `path` and `action`. The documentation is very sparse on those. \r\nPath allows you to override the path where the request is sent, this can be used for services like S3 for example. \r\n`action` allows you to target an AWS service action directly, and you might or might not need to give very specific data like the `X-Amz-Target` header to your request. \r\n\r\nBefore, we would specify a sub type of integration for each service, but after looking deeply into it with @cloutierMat, we realized it is only one integration in the end, with maybe a few differences between services but that are generalizable between services.\r\nIf things get out of control with specific behavior for the `action` type, we could register a \"before send\" and \"after response\" callback to fix the request/response before sending it for specific services. It's worth to say that there is literally zero documentation about the `action` type and which/how services are supported. \r\n\r\nWhich means we're now support way more services out of the box when using `path` URI! \ud83d\ude80 \r\n\r\nBy running all the AWS integrations test (which now all pass \u2705), I've spotted a few bugs that have been fixed in the PR as well. \r\n\r\nAs a side note, this PR put into light the fact that AWS still supports the Query Protocol for the SSM service, and that API Gateway still sends request with that protocol by default to SSM... even though the botocore specs have always been the JSON specs. Fun \ud83d\ude2c \\cc @alexrashed you might like that one... \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement a generalized way to support `AWS` integration\r\n  - support the `path` type which is very simple\r\n  - for the `action` type, it is a bit more complicated and will still need a bit of effort to support new services, since it seems they fall into different categories. \r\n- validate existing tests with AWS integrations (DynamoDB, SQS, SFn, Kinesis, EventBridge, Lambda, SSM and S3) \r\n  - moved the SFn test into its own file\r\n- change how we mapped default values for `Content-Type` and `Accept` for integration request (not passthrough but provided by AWS)\r\n- implement rendering of URI, still need to implement more tests in the future\r\n- skip `needs_fixing` tests for the new provider, as they often don't setup APIGW correctly\r\n- last fix (last in list): fix the access to the REST API to be case insensitive when fetching the stage variables\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nNow with the new provider enabled, all APIGW tests only are passing locally! We will soon enable a new pipeline for the APIGW provider only. \r\n\r\nStill 8 failing tests in the pipeline, fixed with #11198:\r\n```\r\nFAILED

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\ntest_event_patterns.py was intentional focusing on the \"event_patterns\" being a shared functionality used beyond the scope of EventBridge (Pipes, Lambda ESM, potentially SNS). Using the naming test_events_* for consistency here, although fully following it would lead to the weird naming test_events_event_pattern . \r\nThis test file should contain all the tests related to event pattern, this means testing the pattern matching engine on its own, but also testing the API `test_event_pattern` as well as rules with event pattern.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs reported in #11180, we've had the wrong behavior for DeleteMarker with `ObjectTagging` operations. \r\n\r\nHowever, my previous assumptions were wrong due to a mistake in a test, which lead to a design decision in the S3 models (the `S3Bucket` `get_object` method signature). \r\n\r\nWe will need to update it to support properly this behavior, however this might break persistence as the previous loaded objects might have the previous signature, and fails when used in the provider. We will need to wait for the next major release to remove the previous parameter `raise_for_delete_marker` and add a new one permitting use to separate behavior between calls from `GetObject` vs `GetObjectTagging` (one raise `NoSuchKey` and the other `MethodNotAllowed`). \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- add a hacky way to support the behavior reported, and add a TODO for the future to fix the behavior without that

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nWhile implementing the `AWS_PROXY` integration with #11167, I've stumbled onto a weird issue: AWS would raise an `INTEGRATION_FAILURE` error, which the default status code should be 504 (Gateway Timeout, that's already suspicious), but instead returned `500`. \r\n\r\nAfter a lot of investigation with @cloutierMat, we came to the conclusion that the CRUD later (`PutGatewayResponse`, `GetGatewayResponse` etc) is not in line with the actual behavior, and that the actual default status code is `500`, but the CRUD calls still returns 504. \r\n\r\nThis PR implements the logic to enable the difference between the CRUD layer and the actual invocation layer by attaching a default status code to the exception, while still using the previous default for other exceptions, allowing us to override the behavior. \r\n\r\nThis behavior is validated by `tests.aws.services.apigateway.test_apigateway_lambda.test_lambda_aws_proxy_integration_non_post_method`. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- use the Python exception status code if provided\r\n- add a fix in the provider to deal with the inconsistency between what the AWS CRUD operations returns and what AWS actually does under the hood\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-11T13:12:47Z", "updated_at":

However, @alexrashed argued (correctly) that people are still using it and we should keep backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nThis PR does a minimal change to simply make `localstack start --host` basically equivalent to ``python -m localstack.runtime.main``.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* `localstack start --host` now uses the new runtime to start localstack\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* check out the PR, activate venv\r\n* run `python -m localstack.cli.main start --host`, observe it still works\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-11T10:53:57Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T11:26:55Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-11T11:26:53Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-11T11:26:53Z", "merge_commit_sha": "5581b2526d2d44c13f5ae59bc627bb40c7766fa3", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 5361523480, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JbGA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20minor", "name": "semver: minor", "color": "E78F1F", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in minor releases, but not in patch releases"}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11181/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11181/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/11181/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/fc8b0847a5fc35c8024c598a40f5f4dfbb1305bc", "head": {"label": "localstack:fix-cli-host-mode", "ref": "fix-cli-host-mode", "sha": "fc8b0847a5fc35c8024c598a40f5f4dfbb1305bc", "user": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 71948498, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==", "name": "localstack", "full_name": "localstack/localstack", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack", "description": "\ud83d\udcbb A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

This is quite tedious to hunt down on a case-by-case basis, so I thought I'd introduce a util that takes care of this recursively for the whole request kwargs.\r\n\r\nThe reported issue specifically affected `AWS::Events::Rule` and  the downstream `Events.PutTargets` API call when using the `AwsVpcConfiguration` key. On the API side this is actually `awsvpcConfiguration` which lead to an exception being raised on the `client.put_targets` call.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Resource providers now have another util at their disposal. `convert_request_kwargs` can be used to recursively fix issues mapping from the resource properties to the botocore client call.\r\n  - Casing issues are fixed\r\n  - Types are converted automatically between int/str/boolean\r\n  - Unknown keys are dropped\r\n- `AWS::Events::Rule` resources can now successfully be deployed with ecs parameters that include the `AwsVpcConfiguration` property.\r\n\r\n## Discussion\r\n\r\nThis approach can be extended in various ways like:\r\n- ~Drop elements if the input shape doesn't expect them~ :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- ~Convert passed types automatically~ :heavy_check_mark: \r\n- Instrument the boto client factory that we pass into the resource provider to do this automatically via boto hooks\r\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\n@HarshCasper noted that this sample didn't work with the new runtime https://github.com/localstack-samples/localstack-init-hooks/tree/main/example-docker-compose\r\n\r\nThis is because we were running shutdown hooks after the runtime server was shut down. I changed the runtime to correct the order to what we were doing previously.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that we're returning 503 errors when calling `/_localstack` APIs when shutting down, which I find stifles the use of shutdown hooks. I added an exception for those internal APIs.\r\n\r\nMoreover I added a bootstrap test to validate the shutdown hook behaviors\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* Gateway is now shut down _after_ shutdown hooks are run\r\n* `/_localstack` endpoints can now be called while localstack is shutting down\r\n* added a bootstrap test for testing shutdown hooks\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-10T22:26:36Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T10:46:26Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-11T10:44:42Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-11T10:44:42Z", "merge_commit_sha": "8981269aca7a0e917589b0f20dbfcf3267a204fa", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [{"login": "simonrw", "id": 59756, "node_id": "MDQ6VXNlcjU5NzU2", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/59756?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw", "html_url": "https://github.com/simonrw", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/simonrw/received_events", "type": "User", "site_admin": false}], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 5361523480, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JbGA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20minor", "name": "semver: minor", "color": "E78F1F", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in minor releases, but not in patch releases"}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11177/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11177/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/11177/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/87f67cda5ffd5fb4c974ce7a9f200700daeadbe5", "head": {"label": "localstack:shutdown-hooks", "ref": "shutdown-hooks", "sha": "87f67cda5ffd5fb4c974ce7a9f200700daeadbe5", "user": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 71948498, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==", "name": "localstack", "full_name": "localstack/localstack", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack", "description": "\ud83d\udcbb A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\nCurrently, the scaffolding currently translates the `StringShape`s from the botocore specs to enum string classes, for example:\n\n```python\nclass Architecture(str):\n    x86_64 = \"x86_64\"\n    arm64 = \"arm64\"\n```\n\nThe issue here, from a type checking perspective, is that the values, for example Architecture.x86_64, are not of type Architecture, they are simple strings:\n\n```python\nfrom localstack.aws.api.lambda_ import Architecture\n\nprint(isinstance(Architecture.x86_64, Architecture))\nprint(isinstance(Architecture.x86_64, str))\n```\nfor example, returns:\n\n```\nFalse\nTrue\n```\n\nThis is not really an issue for production - they are strings, and the exact type does not really matter after it is serialized anyway. However, when developing, we are hit with fun IDE warnings and mypy also reports it as an error:\n\n```python\ndef test(param: Architecture):\n    pass\n\n\ntest(Architecture.arm64)\n```\n\nMypy error:\n\n```bash\nmypy test.py\ntest.py:14: error: Argument 1 to \"test\" has incompatible type \"str\"; expected \"Architecture\"  [arg-type]\nFound 1 error in 1 file (checked 1 source file)\n```\n\nMy proposed solution would be to switch those types to StrEnum, a new type of enum introduced with python3.11 (https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html#enum.StrEnum). It is only applicable for code not used by the CLI, but our API scaffolds should not be imported from the CLI.\n\nA StrEnum is both an instance of str and enum, and more importantly, the members are also a type of the respective class.\nAlso, the dunder __str__ and __repr__ methods are those of string, therefore it should be interchangable (we will see how the testing of this PR works out).\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* Use `StrEnum` instead of `str` for generated API `StringShape`s, which will lead to correct types for the enum members.\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ]

It (a) adjusts the coverage config a bit such that the package path and the source config are properly separated, and (b) removes an obsolete coverage-related dev container config which is not used anymore.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Removes the `CoverageRunScriptConfigurator` since the `run-coverage.py` is not used anymore.\r\n- Slightly changes the `pyproject.toml` to properly separate between the configuration of the sources and the package lookup config.\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n- [x] Wait for the removal of the usage of `run-coverage.py` in our downstream dependency.", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\nOur current usage of bind mounts in docker utilizes the docker `volumes` API. However, this API has been superceded by the `mounts` API.\nThere was also one, so far unsuccessful, try to use `mounts` for everything in LocalStack, with #9887.\n\nThere are some drawbacks when using the mounts API for bind mounts, for example the fact that the host path is not automatically created.\nHowever, it would also achieve many advantages, like being able to mount subpaths of named volumes into containers.\n\nTo prepare for the future use of mounts, for now in addition to volumes, this PR renames all current occurrences of `mounts` or `mount_volumes` to `volumes`, to make the differenciation clearer.\nWe can then start to implement the mounts API in the docker client, and step by step migrate usages of `volumes` to `mounts` - where possible, as well as enable new usecases, like using a named volume as mount point for `/var/lib/localstack`, or adding `tmpfs` file systems to compute containers.\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* No userfacing changes\n* Rename all occurrences of `mounts` or `mount_volumes` when using the docker client to `volumes`\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\n<!--\n## Testing\n\n-->\n\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\n<!--\n## TODO\n\nWhat's left to do:\n\n- [ ] ...\n- [ ]

https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/10800 the main module in localstack/localstack has been moved from the root of the repository to the `localstack-core` folder.\r\nUnfortunately, this silently killed the caching in the workflow which runs the Community tests against the LocalStack Pro code (since the `.filesystem` folder now is in `localstack/localstack-core/.filesystem`).\r\nThis PR addresses this issue which should hopefully lead to an increase in the pipeline stability.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Adjusts the path for the var lib cache in `tests-pro-integration.yml`",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThis PR implements the `AWS_PROXY` API Gateway integration. \r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/set-up-lambda-proxy-integrations.html\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- populate the `identity` field of the context with the default values for a method with no authorizer\r\n- port a few utils needed for the lambda integration\r\n- implement the `AWS_PROXY` integration, adding the utils to create the input payload and parsing the response from lambda and passing it down the chain\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nAll the tests related to `AWS_PROXY` in `tests.aws.services.apigateway.test_apigateway_lambda` are passing when forcing the provider, with way less snapshot ignore than before \ud83e\udd73 \r\n(With `test_lambda_aws_proxy_integration_non_post_method` depending #11183 to be merged due to the gateway response default value issue).\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] write maybe a bit of unit test\r\n- [ ] manage all exceptions, do validation in console too\r\n- [ ] ?\r\n\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-09T15:52:46Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-12T15:52:44Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-12T15:52:43Z", "merged_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nWhile working on https://github.com/thrau/localstack-terraform-init, I noticed that recursion may be very useful if you want to organize your terraform files into folders, so you can have more than one terraform project.\r\n\r\nI figured this would be generally a useful feature, not just for the extension, so here it is.\r\n\r\nThe scripts are executed with a preorder traversal, and each level is sorted alphabetically, so\r\n```\r\nready.d/myscript.sh\r\nready.d/a/script_0.sh\r\nready.d/a/aa/script_0.sh\r\nready.d/a/aa/script_2.sh\r\nready.d/b/script_0.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is backwards compatible with the way scripts were sorted previously.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* init hook scripts are now discovered recursively in `/etc/localstack/init/<stage>`, meaning that you can have scripts in subdirectories\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-09T08:11:16Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-10T12:56:51Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-10T12:56:49Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-10T12:56:49Z", "merge_commit_sha": "70af8d031a303cb0dab8b176a2dbc8c82f0c8e98", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 5361523480, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JbGA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20minor", "name": "semver: minor", "color": "E78F1F", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in minor releases, but not in patch releases"}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11158/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11158/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/11158/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/03cc9b88101a8cc0e948896901ee9c81206f2acb", "head": {"label": "localstack:init-recursion", "ref": "init-recursion", "sha": "03cc9b88101a8cc0e948896901ee9c81206f2acb", "user": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 71948498, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==", "name": "localstack", "full_name": "localstack/localstack", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack", "description": "\ud83d\udcbb A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

In order to avoid any disturbance, we introduced an intermediary tag `dev` to make sure that we do not break the `latest` image (which is directly used by a lot of our users) too often.\r\nWe have now learned that the acceptance tests in combination with the PR tests are a good gate, and there is no known instance where a dev tag contained issues which would even have been caught by the full integration test suite.\r\nThis is why this PR removes the `dev` tag again, runs on master which only execute the acceptance tests will directly push the `latest` image tag.\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Removes the selective usage of the `dev` tag when only the acceptance tests are executed.\r\n  - Even if only the acceptance tests are executed, we will directly push the `latest` tag.\r\n\r\n/cc

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\n## Motivation\nIn my original PR #11095 I forgot to forward the `log_config` from the container configuration to the actual docker create call in the `create_container_from_config` method, I only added it to `run_container_from_config`.\n\nThis PR fixes this mistake, but cannot be merged until some adaptions in `-ext` take place, due to a naming conflict in the ECS TaskContainerConfiguration.\n\n\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\n## Changes\n* Forward `log_config` parameter in `create_container_from_config` method\n\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nCompletes the core of the Response Integration handler with implementation of response templates. The response template is used to modify the body along with allowing to override headers and response status code. \r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-override-request-response-parameters.html\r\n\r\nSelecting the right template is a bit trickier than for the integration request as aws does not simply select a matching template or passthrough, instead it will select a template if there are templates created. The [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html#transforming-request-response-body) states that if no templates are matched, it will select the first. But there is no mention as to what this first is. It does seem to favor `application/json` no matter if it was created first or not. Over my tests with the console this is the best I could figure out. There might be some extra logic I missed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Template selection\r\n- VTL rendering for the response template\r\n- Apply overrides to headers and status code\r\n- Add the response body.\r\n\r\nOther bug fixes\r\n- Terminate chain in exception handler. to prevent integration response from executing\r\n- Provide default if `requestTemplates=None` to prevent `NoneType Exception`\r\n- Enforce shape of `ContextVarsResponseOverride`\r\n- Fix method request reading from `path` instead of `path_parameters`\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] write unit tests\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-05T04:08:25Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-11T03:20:07Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-11T03:20:06Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-11T03:20:06Z", "merge_commit_sha":

The previous work we have done make those extremely simple to implement and understand, and it shows how much the current work is going to simplify APIGW. \r\n\r\nThe PR also contains a few changes across the board, because we can now test full end-to-end integration tests: the `tests/aws/services/apigateway/test_apigateway_http.py` test file is fully green with the new PR, with improved parity. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implemented the `HTTP` and `HTTP_PROXY` integrations\r\n- change some typing around some existing contexts, as those were not really `Optional` and it helps with making sure we're not lacking data once we're in the integration\r\n- remove the `legacy` handler as we can now enable full end-to-end tests\r\n- remove the full clear of headers when receiving a response from an integration that is not of `_PROXY` type, but instead have a mechanism to keep some\r\n- return the integration response/method response status code for the response\r\n- fix the `path` value, as we would replace the `/<stage>` multiple times through, and if you had a path looking `/test/test` where `test` was your stage and `test` just a regular resource, we're replace everything\r\n- add default values for `Accept` and `Content-Type`, behavior checked with AWS and add test for it\r\n- remove some snapshot skips when running the HTTP integrations integration tests with the new provider\r\n- update some unit tests to be a bit simpler and avoid mistakes\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nSet `PROVIDER_OVERRIDE_APIGATEWAY=next_gen` and run all tests in `tests/aws/services/apigateway/test_apigateway_http.py`, they now all run! \ud83e\udd73 \r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] PR description\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-05T03:01:55Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-08T15:44:38Z",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `x-amzn-errortype` header to all gateway responses.\r\n\r\nThese are not documented and the value of the token isn't consistent from error to error. The `DEFAULT_XXX` errors appears to be raised with different header value depending on the cause of the error.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Add `x_header` to `BaseGatewayException`\r\n- Add the header to the response in the Gateway Exception Handler\r\n- Populate the value for all errors. Only some were validated using the console or curl. The others have been marked with a TODO so as to avoid confusion in the future. As we get more snapshot tests going, we should be able to populate more of them\r\n- Some unit tests were moved out of `/unit/apigateway.py` to help separating the legacy tests with the NG tests.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Just adding a few cross-links to connect these efforts a bit:\r\n- https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/10994\r\n- https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/10991\r\n-

https://github.com/localstack/localstack/pull/9141\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Fixes all but one non-AWS validated kinesis test (the last one fails with an Internal Server Error / 500 by AWS).\r\n- Basically marks most of the opensearch tests as `needs_fixing` (the domain creation fixture is not working against AWS yet), and some as `only_localstack` (there are a lot of tests for the different endpoint strategies).\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-04T15:34:42Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-05T06:28:59Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-05T06:28:57Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-05T06:28:57Z", "merge_commit_sha":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nThroughout APIGW invocation, there are several places where you can use stageVariables inside some URI and ARN. \r\nWe also need to interpolate path parameters inside the Integration URI\r\n\r\nThis PR implements 2 utils, to render stage variables following the VTL syntax, and another one to render path parameters, only in curly braces.\r\nThe Integration Request handler combines those 2 utils to render the Integration URI. \r\n\r\nMore informations about stage variables here:\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/aws-api-gateway-stage-variables-reference.html#stage-variables-in-integration-HTTP-uris\r\n\r\nWe will also use the utils inside the Integration for the credentials, and in the cognito authorizer to render the UserPool. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement stage variables rendering util\r\n- implement path parameters rendering util\r\n- add unit tests for the URI rendering\r\n- renamed a variable inside the template mappings due to a PyCharm linting, as we were overriding the builtin `vars`\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at":

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nAdding VTL Template Mapping to our Integration request handler and port `ApiGatewayVtlTemplate` class to NG provider.\r\n\r\nThe request template allows to create a request body based on the provided VTL template. You can also use it to `#set` requests override the path parameters, headers and query strings. See: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/models-mappings.html\r\n\r\nWhen no templates are found based on content-type, an `UnsupportedMediaTypeError` can be raised depending on the set passthrough behaviour.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Implements `ApiGatewayVtlTemplate`, which is ported and simplified from legacy `templates.py`. \r\n- adds logic for and exception for passthrough behavior\r\n- augments request template with the request overrides\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement unit tests for `ApiGatewayVtlTemplate`. Port from legacy to prevent regressions as we move forward\r\n- [x] Implement unit tests for `IntegrationRequestHandler`. There might be more tests needed as parameters mapping was not tested yet\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-03T20:46:30Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-04T03:04:29Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-04T03:04:28Z",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nCurrently, the StepFunctions v2 provider and interpreter offer no support for [Express Workflows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/dg/concepts-standard-vs-express.html). This PR addresses this by adding base support for Express Workflows.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added execution flavour logic to execution components, now STANDARD or EXPRESS\r\n- Added sync execution components: Execution and ExecutionWorker\r\n- Added static analyser to fail state machine creation that includes illegal callbacks or activities\r\n- Added several validation exceptions concerning limitations of Express workflows\r\n- Added support for [StartSyncExecution api action](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/stepfunctions/start-sync-execution.html)\r\n- Added several supporting utils for express testing\r\n- Added base positive and negative api snapshot tests\r\n- Added positive and negative snapshot tests for sync and async express workflow executions\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section:

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR starts implementing the Integration Response handler, who's responsible for selecting the right `IntegrationResponse` based on the response status code (or an `errorMessage` field very specific to the `AWS` integration with Lambda, which we will tackle later). \r\n\r\nThe handler should then do the response parameters mapping, then the VTL rendering of the body. \r\nWe do not test the handler yet, same as the Integration Request handler, as the behavior is incomplete yet.\r\n\r\nInstead, we can focus on the integration response selection, and the response parameters mapping. All of the unit tests have been manually tested against AWS, with the console and a SSH tunnel with localhost.run to my own small flask server to be able to return arbitrary payload from my HTTP payload. \r\n\r\nMore informations about the different subjects of the PR:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html#mapping-response-parameters\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-integration-settings-integration-response.html\r\n- https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/handle-errors-in-lambda-integration.html?icmpid=apigateway_console_help\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement the base of the Integration Response handler, still very WIP, with comments outlining what I currently think is happening\r\n- ported the current `selectionPattern` util to select the right integration response (thanks @dfangl for implementing it!) and unit test it\r\n- refactor the parameter mapping a bit to share code between request and response parameter mappings (code is still pretty similar, but has a few distinct difference, we could always refactor later on)\r\n- add the response parameter mapping logic \r\n- add unit tests for response parameter mapping\r\n\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] add unit tests for Response Parameters by validating with AWS\r\n- [x] add unit tests for selecting the integration response\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-03T16:51:59Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-04T11:20:02Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-04T11:13:58Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-04T11:13:57Z",

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nIt's currently not easily possible for ext or other modules to add plugin managers to the output list of `/_localstack/plugins`.\r\n\r\nThis internal refactoring creates a class-level list of plugin managers that can be extended using hooks or other discovery mechanisms. Specifically this is used by ext to add the `localstack.platform.plugin` namespace.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n* the output `/_localstack/plugin` can now be extended by other components\r\n* the init `ScriptRunners` introduced in #11098 are now listed correctly\r\n* the `requires_license` output is now shown in the list of plugins, if the plugin has been initialized and the attribute is present\r\n* PluginManagers that were in `/_localstack/plugins` are now imported a bit earlier (when the `PluginsResource` is created, not when it's called for the first time - this should be OK though, since all the code has been imported already through other modules anyway)\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n* Run `python -m localstack.dev.run`\r\n* Observe that `curl -s localhost.localstack.cloud:4566/_localstack/plugins` still works ;-)\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n-->\r\n", "created_at": "2024-07-03T16:01:17Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-05T10:00:01Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-05T10:00:00Z", "merged_at": "2024-07-05T10:00:00Z", "merge_commit_sha": "fb88ff27c69f6774c706deea9c195775487a38ba", "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "requested_reviewers": [], "requested_teams": [], "labels": [{"id": 5361523480, "node_id": "LA_kwDOBEnY0s8AAAABP5JbGA", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/labels/semver:%20minor", "name": "semver: minor", "color": "E78F1F", "default": false, "description": "Non-breaking changes which can be included in minor releases, but not in patch releases"}], "milestone": null, "draft": false, "commits_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11134/commits", "review_comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/11134/comments", "review_comment_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/pulls/comments{/number}", "comments_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/issues/11134/comments", "statuses_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/localstack/localstack/statuses/704332d2ef0ce148574d69ae05663fb141342d4b", "head": {"label": "localstack:plugin-endpoint", "ref": "plugin-endpoint", "sha": "704332d2ef0ce148574d69ae05663fb141342d4b", "user": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "repo": {"id": 71948498, "node_id": "MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnk3MTk0ODQ5OA==", "name": "localstack", "full_name": "localstack/localstack", "private": false, "owner": {"login": "localstack", "id": 28732122, "node_id": "MDEyOk9yZ2FuaXphdGlvbjI4NzMyMTIy", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/28732122?v=4", "gravatar_id": "", "url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack", "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack", "followers_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/followers", "following_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/following{/other_user}", "gists_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/gists{/gist_id}", "starred_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/starred{/owner}{/repo}", "subscriptions_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/subscriptions", "organizations_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/orgs", "repos_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/repos", "events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/events{/privacy}", "received_events_url": "https://api.github.com/users/localstack/received_events", "type": "Organization", "site_admin": false}, "html_url": "https://github.com/localstack/localstack", "description": "\ud83d\udcbb A fully functional local AWS cloud stack.

extending our ASF parsers and serializers, and patching CBOR support into `botocore` (when being used as a proxy to `kinesis-mock`).\r\nUnfortunately, AWS does not properly implement the CBOR spec when it comes to timestamp handling:\r\n- [RFC8949](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8949) defines CBOR timestamps as floating-point epoch seconds:\r\n  > The tag content MUST be an unsigned or negative integer (major types 0 and 1) or a floating-point number (major type 7 with additional information 25, 26, or 27).\r\n  > ...\r\n  > To indicate fractional seconds, floating-point values can be used within tag number 1 instead of integer values.\r\n- AWS however uses milliseconds as nicely described in this issue: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/4661\r\n  - This means that when using a standard-compliant parser, the timestamps multiplied by 1000 (resulting in an error - \"ValueError: year 56474 is out of range\"):\r\n    ```\r\n    2024-07-03T13:30:33.095 ERROR ---

instead of native timestamps.\r\nThe AWS SDK does perform a native timestamp serialization, which again leads to parsing errors (mentioned above, see reproducer linked in \"Testing\").\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses the CBOR timestamp parsing/serialization issues directly when using `cbor2` to en-/decode the binary data.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, cbor2 does not easily allow patching standard en-/decoder functions, which is why the fix only works if the Python-native cbor loading code is explicitly imported from the respective private modules (happy for any input on how to make this more stable / better): https://github.com/agronholm/cbor2/issues/192\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Patches `cbor2` datetime encoding and decoding.\r\n- Adjusts all imports of `cbor2` to explicitly use the Python implementation instead of the C / native library.\r\n- Fixes the parser (removes an invalid assumption that binary data is not also base64 encoded).\r\n- Fixes the serializer (removed timestamp handling in the serializer - done natively by `cbor2` now).\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n- I created a reproducer using the AWS Java SDK to showcase this issue: https://github.com/alexrashed/kinesis-cbor-reproducer and verified the changes here with this reproducer / the AWS Java SDK.\r\n- I added an AWS-verified plain-request CBOR integration test, testing CBOR serialization and deserialization.\r\n\r\nFixes #9699", "created_at": "2024-07-03T13:04:07Z", "updated_at": "2024-07-04T12:28:04Z", "closed_at": "2024-07-04T12:28:02Z", "merged_at":

Currently, however, the suite of acceptance tests is not very extensive. \r\nTo facilitate (correct) growth here, we need guidance on what acceptance tests exactly are and what we expect of them.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new section to the contribution documentation, documenting the different types of tests we execute in our CI pipeline.\r\nThe main focus is documentation about acceptance tests, when they are executed, what is expected of them, and how new ones can be developed.\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\nAs @cloutierMat reported, when actually using the next gen APIGW provider, we would not properly route requests, because we had the full path containing the `stage` which didn't map properly to any created Werkzeug Rule. This is how APIGW represents their `path`, this is only what is after the `stage`. \r\n\r\nOnly the `$context.path` contains the `stage` and `path`, so we can get weird snapshot with one field named `path` containing `/your-path` and one named `requestContext.path` containing `/stage-name/your-path`. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \r\n\r\nWe also had the issue with the `ANY` method, we would try to pass that when creating a Werkzeug Rule. \r\nWe now create a special case where `ANY` gets mapped to `DELETE`, `GET`, `HEAD`, `OPTIONS`, `PATCH`, `POST`, and `PUT` (the supported HTTP methods of APIGW).\r\n\r\nI was worried about having a rule order issue in Werkzeug, but this proved to not be a problem because we only return the `Resource` from the match, and we can manually get the right `resourceMethod` afterwards. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- create a new Werkzeug Rule to take into account the `ANY` method\r\n- remove the stage from the path in the parsing step\r\n- add new tests for the `ANY` method with different order of creation\r\n- update tests to have the stage in the `Request` path \r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n##

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nThis PR implements Parameter Mappings and the base util class. It is also integrated into the Integration Request handler, but that part is still untested because we will wait for the handler to be complete before testing its behavior. \r\n\r\nMore informations about Parameters Mappings in this documentation page:\r\nhttps://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html\r\n\r\nIt allows you to map values from your incoming request (path parameters, query string and headers), as well as the body and even parts of the body with JSON Path. You can also map values from the `$context` variable and stage variables, as well as static data. \r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- implement a small change to Gateway Response, as it seems AWS is raising `DEFAULT_4XX` exceptions directly and that wasn't expected. We can now specify a status code directly at runtime when raising this kind of exception\r\n- implement the `ParametersMapper` class which contains the method to get the needed values for your integration request: header, path parameters and query string. \r\n- implement unit tests to validate the behavior. Most of these unit tests have been written by checking with the AWS Console, but will need to be ported to a few integration tests to confirm behavior. \r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before it can be merged? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [ ] ...\r\n- [ ]

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n- Calling `StartExecution` with the same `name` and `input` payload as a currently running execution should be idempotent for `STANDARD` workflows . \r\n- That is, the  `StartExecution` request should succeed and return the same response as the original `StartExecution` request (from #11104)\r\n\r\nFrom [AWS StartExecution docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/step-functions/latest/apireference/API_StartExecution.html):\r\n> StartExecution is idempotent for STANDARD workflows. For a STANDARD workflow, if you call StartExecution with the same name and input as a running execution, the call succeeds and return the same response as the original request. If the execution is closed or if the input is different, it returns a 400 ExecutionAlreadyExists error. You can reuse names after 90 days.\r\n>\r\n> StartExecution isn't idempotent for EXPRESS workflows.\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n- Added `_idempotent_start_execution` function that returns a `RUNNING` execution matching `input` and `name` parameters for workflows of type `STANDARD`;  and associated tests in `test_start_execution_idempotent`\r\n- Added a shorter wait-and-pass BaseTemplate that waits 10 seconds before passing.\r\n- Fixed a typo when naming snapshot in `test_describe_execution`  (`ddescribe -> describe`).\r\n- Fixed `test_start_execution` test by skipping `redriveCount` check.\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes?

Add context such as related issues, PRs, or documentation. -->\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nImplementation of a new api key validation handler. There is a mix of moto helpers in the implementation as not all relevant information live in the deployment. \r\n\r\n#### Important configuration in the frozen deployment:\r\n- The resource method describes `apiKeyRequired`, which determines if validation is required or skipped.\r\n- The rest api describes `apiKeySource`, which determines if the key is to be retrieved from the headers or from an identity context populated by an Lambda Authorizer\r\n\r\n#### Important configuration in apigateway store.\r\nThose items, when created, modified or deleted, will affect a deployment without the need to redeploy. see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/updating-api.html\r\n- Api keys and their properties are stored in moto (contradicts the documentation, but manually tested that updating `enabled` from the key will affect without redeploying)\r\n- Usage plans are stored in moto\r\n- Usage plan key (association of a key to a usage plan) are also stored in moto\r\n\r\n<!-- What changes does this PR make? How does LocalStack behave differently now? -->\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- Finds and validates api key based on deployment configuration and keys/usage plans stored on the backend\r\n- Updates the `$context` variables with relevant data.\r\n- Added `moto_helpers` to keep moto backend isolated and ease technical debt.\r\n- Added tests to validate functionality\r\n\r\n## TODO\r\n\r\nWhat's left to do:\r\n\r\n- [x] This PR currently targets #11111, as it requires changes to the imports. When merged, we should rebase and target master\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: How to test these changes? -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Optional section: What's left to do before
